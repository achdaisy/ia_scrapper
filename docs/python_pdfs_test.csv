httpswww.vestnik-donstu.rujourarticleview21101904,Automation of the Formation of a Mathematical Formulation of Kinetics for Multistage Chemical Reactions and Numerical Solution to a Direct Problem,Unknown Author,"<p style=""margin:5px 0px;color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:'PT Sans', sans-serif;font-size:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);""><strong>Introduction</strong><strong>.</strong> The basis for research, analysis and mathematical optimization of any chemical process is an adequate mathematical model that takes into account the kinetics of the object. Kinetic analysis is a challenge in chemical technology, since it allows for optimizing synthesis processes and predicting their efficiency. Numerous chemical processes involve several stage reactions. For successful design and optimization, a mathematical model that describes each stage is needed. Creating such a model manually can be time-consuming and costly, since it requires processing a large amount of information. The modern level of automation makes it possible to accelerate the obtaining of a mathematical formulation of the kinetics of multistage reactions. In this case, working with data is greatly simplified, and the probability of making mistakes is reduced. The resulting mathematical model can be applied for further analysis and optimization of the process. The paper considers the industrial reaction of catalytic reforming of gasoline, which occupies an important place in the modern scheme of oil refining, since it is a source of high-octane components of commercial gasolines and individual aromatic hydrocarbons. This process is characterized by the participation of a large number (up to 300) of various hydrocarbons, a change in the number of moles, and non-isothermality in it. Mathematical modeling of such processes involves detailing the stages to the required level. The detailing of up to 173 stages is considered. In this setting, automation of the formation of a mathematical formulation of kinetics for catalytic reforming of gasoline has not been carried out before. Therefore, the presented work aimed at implementing effective numerical methods and algorithms for automating the building of a mathematical model taking into account kinetics, thermodynamics, and changes in the number of moles.</p><p style=""margin:5px 0px;color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:'PT Sans', sans-serif;font-size:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);""><strong>Materials and Methods</strong><strong>.</strong> The mathematical formulation of the kinetics of multistage reactions was developed on the basis of the mass action law. The kinetic parameters values were taken from literary sources. The direct kinetics problem was solved using algorithms: the Gear method, the Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order, and the scipy.odeint() method of the Python language. The automation concept was implemented using the IDEF0 methodology. The software was written in the Python programming language.</p><p style=""margin:5px 0px;color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:'PT Sans', sans-serif;font-size:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);""><strong>Results</strong><strong>.</strong> A new software was created to automate the process of forming a mathematical model, taking into account the kinetics, thermodynamics, and the volume of the reaction mixture. The program results were presented by the example of catalytic reforming of gasoline. The model implemented the possibility of taking into account the intermediate heating of the mixture in the reactor cascade. Numerical values of temperature changes corresponding to industrial data were obtained.</p><p style=""margin:5px 0px;color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:'PT Sans', sans-serif;font-size:17px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);""><strong>Discussion and Conclusion</strong><strong>.</strong> The results obtained through modeling chemical transformations in the cascade of gasoline catalytic reforming reactors confirmed the exothermic nature of the reaction. The developed software product provides displaying changes in the concentrations of reactants, as well as temperature variations in the reactor, and it can be used in scientific research organizations for the analysis of multistage catalytic processes. The results of the reaction kinetics modeling will be used in the subsequent optimization of the process conditions in production.</p>","['folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']",

33-22206,Comparison of various data mining methods for early diagnosis of human cardiology,A,"Recent healthcare reports indicate clearly an increasing mortality rates worldwide which puts a significant burden on the healthcare sector due to different diseases. Coronary artery diseases (CAD) is one of the main reasons of these uprising death rates since it affects the heart directly. For early diagnosis and treatment of CADs, a swiftly growing technology called data mining has been used to collect and categorize necessary data from patients; age, blood sugar and pressure, a type of thorax pain, cholesterol, and so on. Therefore, this paper adopted four data mining methods; decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes (NB) to achieve the goal. The paper utilized the Cleveland dataset along with Python programming language to compare among the four data mining methods in terms of precision, accuracy, recall, and area under the curve. The results illustrated that NB method has the best accuracy of 89.47% compared with previous studies which will help with accurate, fast and inexpensive diagnosis of CADs.",opensource,

httpsjai.in.uaindex.phpd0b0d180d185d196d0b2paper_num1585,INTEGRATION OF THE METHODS OF ALGEBRA OF ALGORITHMS AND COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR AUTOMATION OF PROGRAM SYSTEMS DESIGN,A,"An approach to the creation of intelligent systems is considered, which combines the ideas of Glushkov’s algebra of algorithms with the well-known neuroevolutionary algorithms of computational intelligence, which can be used to automate the design and synthesis of programs. The method of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies is intended to reduce the dimensionality of the space for searching for neural network parameters in the form of gradual development of its structure in the process of evolution. A software toolkit has been developed to support the approach, which is based on the construction of high-level specifications of algorithms represented in systems of algorithmic algebras, and generation of corresponding programs based on implementation templates in a target programming language. Parameterized algorithms called hyperschemes are used to solve a certain class of problems. Setting specific values of parameters and subsequent interpretation of hyperschemes allows obtaining algorithms adapted to specific application conditions. The developed program design and synthesis toolkit provides step-by-step development of programs, starting from a high-level algebraic-algorithmic specification. At the output of the toolkit, a program is automatically generated in one of the target programming languages (С, С++, Java, Python), that also include a subject-oriented language for designing neural networks. The mentioned language includes operators and conditions for working with populations, configurations, genomes, and fitness function. The work of the toolkit is illustrated by the example of designing a parameterized evaluation algorithm for a binary multiplexer and generation of a program for the single-pole balancing problem.","['aipi.ua-collection', 'additional_collections']",

Though children's rights and protections are at the center of debates on digital privacy, safety, and Internet governance, the dominant online platforms have not been constructed with the needs and interests of children in mind. The editors of this volume, Mizuko Ito, Remy Cross, Karthik Dinakar, and Candice Odgers, focus on understanding diverse children's evolving relationships with algorithms, digital data, and platforms and offer guidance on how stakeholders can shape these relationships in ways that support children's agency and protect them from harm. </p><p>This book includes essays reporting original research on educational programs in AI relational robots and Scratch programming, on children's views on digital privacy and artificial intelligence, and on discourses around educational technologies. Shorter opinion pieces add the perspectives of an instructional designer, a social worker, and parents. The contributing social, behavioral, and computer scientists represent perspectives and contexts that span education, commercial tech platforms, and home settings. They analyze problems and offer solutions that elevate the voices and agency of parents and children. Their essays also build on recent research examining how social media, digital games, and learning technologies reflect and reinforce unequal childhoods.</p><p><strong>Contributors:</strong>Paulo Blikstein, Izidoro Blikstein, Marion Boulicault, Cynthia Breazeal, Michelle Ciccone, Sayamindu Dasgupta, Devin Dillon, Stefania Druga, Jacqueline M.

    摘要:
   </b>
   A simulation code, GOAT, is developed to simulate single-bunch intensity-dependent effects and their interplay in the proton ring (pRing) of the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC) project. GOAT is a scalable and portable macroparticle tracking code written in Python and coded by object-oriented programming technology. It allows for transverse and longitudinal tracking, including impedance, space charge effect, electron cloud effect, and beam-beam interaction. In this paper, physical models and numerical approaches for the four types of high-intensity effects, together with the benchmark results obtained through other simulation codes or theories, are presented and discussed. In addition, a numerical application of the cross-talk simulation between the beam-beam interaction and transverse impedance is shown, and a dipole instability is observed below the respective instability threshold. Different mitigation measures implemented in the code are used to suppress the instability. The flexibility, completeness, and advancement demonstrate that GOAT is a powerful tool for beam dynamics studies in the EicC project or other high-intensity accelerators.

NASA_NTRS_Archive_20230001092,NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) 20230001092: Framework for Extensible,N,"Most parallel scientific programs contain compiler directives (pragmas) such as those from OpenMP, explicit calls to runtime library procedures such as those implementing the Message Passing Interface (MPI), or compiler-specific language extensions such as those provided by CUDA. By contrast, the recent Fortran standards empower developers to express parallel algorithms without directly referencing lower-level parallel programming models. Fortran’s parallel features place the language within the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) class of programming models. When writing programs that exploit data-parallelism, application developers often find it straightforward to develop custom parallel algorithms. Problems involving complex, heterogeneous, staged calculations, however, pose much greater challenges. Such applications require careful coordination of tasks in a manner that respects dependencies prescribed by a directed acyclic graph. When rolling one’s own solution proves difficult, extending a customizable framework becomes attractive. The paper presents the design, implementation, and use of the Framework for Extensible Asynchronous Task Scheduling (FEATS), which we believe to be the first task-scheduling tool written in modern Fortran. We describe the benefits and compromises associated with choosing Fortran as the implementation language, and we propose ways in which future Fortran standards can best support the use case in this paper.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']",

In the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) framework, such a concept is envisioned, where aerial vehicles operate beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) within specifically reserved and time stamped “corridors” in the airspace. For example, these corridors or operational intent volumes can connect an aerial vehicle’s origin site to its destination site for package delivery operations.\nThere may also be more than one corridor available for an aerial vehicle to choose from and\noften different corridors may intersect with one another. Thus, it is imperative to ensure flight trajectories belonging to different aerial vehicles are not in conflict. Per the UTM CONOPs, we assume that a vehicle almost always stays inside its corridor or operational volume. \n\nThis work provides a framework for strategic deconfliction of UTM or package delivery\ndrones, where we schedule the departure time of all vehicles subject to various temporal\nconstraints (including the corridor deconfliction at the intersections). We present the “multi-route weighted package delivery problem” which serves as an exemplifying model for strategic deconfliction in UTM. In the multi-route weighted package delivery problem, a graph network is given which consists of a set of depots (source) and drop-off (destination) nodes, with multiple routes (defined as a sequence of waypoints) connecting the depots to drop-off nodes. In addition, routes are weighted by the associated ground risk and total travel distance for package delivery.\nThe goal is for a known set of aerial vehicles to depart from the depots, choose a route and take off time, while avoiding conflicts with other aerial vehicles, and minimizing both risk and distance traveled. We provide a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the problem, as well as a heuristic solution based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) – a method used in game theory and artificial intelligence – to overcome limitations inherent to optimal solvers.\n\nComputational results show the advantages of using MCTS over the MILP formulation;\nthe former can provide a sub-optimal solution quickly, and may sometimes even reach an\noptimal solution, whereas the latter may not even produce a solution in reasonable time.\nFurthermore, results from both the MILP formulation and MCTS methods were validated using a preliminary agent-based simulator implementing the UTM concept of operations. Thus, the MCTS method can be seen as a scalable solution to the complex multi-route weighted package delivery problem and may possibly be extended to similar complex optimization problems.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']",

07-2104-1034,A Data-driven Model for Predicting the Yield of Recoverable Sugar from Sugarcane,Unknown Author,"<strong>Introduction</strong><br />Sugarcane is a strategic agricultural 
product and increasing productivity and self-sufficiency in its 
production is of special importance. The most important product of 
sugarcane is sugar. Various factors like climatic and management 
conditions affect the yield of sugarcane and recoverable sugar. Crop 
yield forecasting is one of the most important topics in precision 
agriculture, which is used to estimate yield, match product supply with 
demand and manage product to increase productivity. The purpose of this 
study is to predict and model the factors affecting sugar extracted from
 sugarcane (recoverable sugar) in the farms of Amir-Kabir sugarcane 
agro-industry Company of Khuzestan province using machine learning 
methods.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods</strong><br />To conduct this 
study, data from the agro-industrial company Amir-Kabir in the province 
of Khuzestan from 2010 to 2017 were used. This data has 3223 records 
which include four sets of data: climate, soil, crop and farm 
management. This data includes continuous and discrete variables. 
Discrete variables include production management, soil type, farm, 
variety, age (cane class), the month of harvest and times irrigation. 
Continuous variables include area, chemical fertilizer consumption, 
water consumption per hectare, total water consumption, drain, crop 
season duration, yield (cane yield) soil EC, purity, time interval 
drying off to crop harvest, precipitation, min and max temperature, min 
and max relative humidity, wind speed and evaporation. The recoverable 
sugar variable is considered as the target variable and is divided into 
two classes, values greater than or equal to 9 are in the optimal class 
and less than 9 are in the undesirable class. The other variables are 
considered as predictor variables. For modeling using the Holdout method
 the data were randomly divided into two independent sets, a training 
set and a test set. 70% of the data which includes 2256 records were 
used for training and 30% of the data which includes 967 records were 
used for testing. The modeling of this study was performed with the 
Python programming language version 3.8.6 in the Jupyter notebook 
environment. Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost and SVM (support vector 
machine) algorithms were used for modeling.<br /><strong>Results and Discussion</strong><br />To
 evaluate the models, metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score 
and k-fold cross validation were used. The XGBoost model with 94.8% 
accuracy on the training set and the Adaboost model with 92.4% accuracy 
on the test set, are the best models. Based on precision and recall 
metrics Adaboost model with 87% precision and SVM model with 87% recall 
have better performance than the other models. Based on Repeated 10-fold
 stratified cross validation using two repeats the SVM model with 92.3% 
accuracy is the best model. The variables of purity, time interval 
drying off to crop harvest and crop season duration are the most 
important variables in predicting the recoverable sugar.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In
 this study a new approach based on machine learning methods for 
predicting recoverable sugar from sugarcane was presented. The most 
important innovation of this study is the simultaneous consideration of 
management and climatic factors, along with other factors such as soil 
and crop characteristics for modeling and classification the recoverable
 sugar percentage from sugarcane. The results show that the performance 
of all models is acceptable and machine learning methods and ensemble 
learning algorithms can be used to predict crop yield. The results of 
this study and the analysis of the rules obtained from the set of 
decision trees made in the random forest model can be used for managers 
of different agro-industries in determining appropriate strategies and 
preparing the conditions to achieve optimal production.<br />For future 
research as well as policy making and decision making Amir-Kabir 
sugarcane agro-industry Company the following suggestions are offered: 
more samples can be used to obtain more reliable results. Also can be 
used Deep learning methods, time series analysis and image processing. 
Use of IOT equipment to collect and real-time processing data on

   </b>
   平方公里阵列(Square Kilometre Array, SKA)射电望远镜的数据处理是通过管线方式进行的,管 线的执行效率是SKA区域中心考虑的重要因素.连续谱成像观测是SKA的主要观测模式之一,也是许 多科学工作的基础.本文以SKA低频先导设备(Murchison Widefield Array, MWA)的成像管线为例,在 中国SKA区域中心原型机(China SKA Regional Centre prototype, CSRC-P)上进行并行处理管线优化.以往的优化方案都集中在少数性能热点,缺乏对整体管线的系统优化,导致整体加速比相对较低.针对这一 问题,本文提出了一种全局优化方案,针对管线使用多种编程语言、图像数据可独立处理的特点,综合使用C+ +多线程、Python多进程、Shell多任务并行等优化方法,并验证了优化结果的准确性.实验表明,优 化后的代码在CSRC-P的x86节点和ARM节点上分别获得了2.7和2.4倍加速. ARM计算节点展现出 对SKA应用良好的适应性.本文的优化策略和方法也适用于其他SKA科学应用,对SKA先导望远镜的 科学运行和未来的运行有帮助.

    Abstract:
   </b>
   Data processing of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is carried out in pipeline mode, and the execution efficiency of pipeline is an important factor to be considered in SKA data processing. Continuum imaging is one of the main observation modes of SKA and is a prerequisite for many other scientific works. In this paper, we take the imaging pipeline of SKA low-frequency precursor Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), as an example and optimize the parallel processing pipeline on the China SKA Regional Centre prototype (CSRC-P). Previous optimization schemes have focused on a few performance hotspots and lacked systematic optimization of the overall pipeline, resulting in a relatively poor overall speedup ratio. In this paper, we propose a global optimization scheme that combines C++ multi-threading, Python multi-processing, and Shell multi-tasking parallelism for pipelines using multiple programming languages and image datasets that can be processed independently, and verify the accuracy of the optimization results. Experiments show taht the optimized pipeline achieves an overall speedup of 2.7 and 2.4 times on the x86 and ARM nodes of CSRC-P, respectively, and the ARM compute nodes shows good adaptability to SKA applications. The optimization strategies and methods in this paper are also applicable to other SKA applications and will be useful for the scientific operation and future operation of the SKA precursor telescope.

In recent years, K–12 computer education has shifted from computer science itself to the broader perspective of computational thinking (CT), which is less about technology than a way of thinking and solving problems—“a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists,” in the words of Jeanette Wing, author of a foundational article on CT. This volume introduces a variety of approaches to CT in K–12 education, offering a wide range of international perspectives that focus on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and the integration of computing and physical objects.</p><p>The book first offers an overview of CT and its importance in K–12 education, covering such topics as the rationale for teaching CT; programming as a general problem-solving skill; and the “phenomenon-based learning” approach. It then addresses the educational implications of the explosion in AI research, discussing, among other things, the importance of teaching children to be conscientious designers and consumers of AI. Finally, the book examines the increasing influence of physical devices in CT education, considering the learning opportunities offered by robotics.</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong></p><p>Harold Abelson, Cynthia Breazeal, Karen Brennan, Michael E.

    摘要:
   </b>
   无人驾驶汽车由于其有限的电池寿命和计算能力，难以在保证续航的前提下满足一些时延敏感任务或密集任务的处理需求。为解决该问题，在移动边缘计算(mobile edge computing，MEC)的背景下，提出了一种基于深度Q网络(deep Q-network，DQN)的无人驾驶任务卸载策略。首先，定义了一个基于任务优先级的“车-边-云”协同任务卸载模型，其需要通过联合优化车辆计算能力与任务卸载策略以获取系统最小延迟和能耗。由于该问题是个混合整数非线性规划问题，因此分两步对其进行求解—通过数学推导得出了最优车辆计算能力的解析解，之后在其数值固定条件下，基于DQN算法获得了任务最佳卸载策略。最后，综合SUMO、Pytorch和Python等工具建立了仿真模型，比较了DQN算法和其他三种算法在任务负载、MEC服务器计算能力以及能耗权重系数变化情况下的性能，实验结果验证了所提策略的可行性和优越性。

    Abstract:
   </b>
   Due to its limited battery life and computing power, driverless cars are difficult to meet the processing needs of some delay-sensitive tasks or intensive tasks while ensuring battery life. To solve this problem, in the context of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) , this paper proposed an driverless task offloading policy based on deep Q-network (DQN) . First, this paper defined a ""vehicle-edge-cloud"" cooperative task offloading model based on task priority, which needs to jointly optimize the computing power of the vehicle and the task offloading policy to obtain the minimum delay and energy consumption of the system. Since the problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and is NP-hard, this paper solved it in two steps—the first step obtained the analytical solution for the optimal computation power of vehicle through mathematical derivation, and then, under the fixed numerical value condition, the DQN algorithm obtained the optimal offloading strategy of the task. Finally, this paper established a simulation model by integrating tools such as SUMO, Pytorch and Python. This paper compared the DQN algorithm and the other three algorithms under different task loads, MEC server computation powers and energy consumption weight co-efficients. The experimental results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed policy.

10.11591eei.v11i2.3562,Integration of convolutional neural network and extreme gradient boosting for breast cancer detection,B,"With the most recent advances in technology, computer programming has
reached the capabilities of human brain to decide things for almost all
healthcare systems. The implementation of convolutional neural network
(CNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is expected to improve the
accurateness of breast cancer detection. The aims of this research were to; i)
determine the stages of CNN-XGBoost integration in diagnosis of breast
cancer and ii) calculate the accuracy of the CNN-XGBoost integration in
breast cancer detection. By combining transfer learning and data
augmentation, CNN with XGBoost as a classifier was used. After acquiring
accuracy results through transfer learning, this reasearch connects the final
layer to the XGBoost classifier. Furthermore, the interface design for the
evaluation process was established using the Python programming language
and the Django platform. The results: i) the stages of CNN-XGBoost
integration on histopathology images for breast cancer detection were
discovered. ii) achieved a higher level of accuracy as a result of the CNNXGBoost integration for breast cancer detection. In conclusion, breast cancer
detection was revealed through the integration of CNN-XGBoost through
histopathological images. The combination of CNN and XGBoost can
enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection.","['journals_contributions', 'journals']",

determine the effectiveness of prevention methods such as masks policy,
social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, and lockdown. Every preventive
measure is modeled based on an equivalent actual event and every essential
aspect that affects the course of the pandemic. A person is represented as a
circle moving freely in two-dimensional space, and disease spreads through
person-to-person contact. This simulator then tested using parameters to
simulate COVID-19 and found significant results between communities that
implement preventive measures and those that do not. We found that within
106 days, 284 people were infected, but when five preventive methods are
applied for a total of 33 days, only 31 people were infected. Adequate to
simulate epidemic events and their prevention measures, this simulator can
also be used as a learning tool with factors in epidemic events such as
population density, mobility, infection rate, disease mortality, and every
effect of each preventive measure. Users can change and influence the

A handful of long-term follow-up studies of pre-K have also found that these programs can have lasting beneficial impacts on critical outcomes into adulthood, such as educational attainment, employment, and income. In the large majority of studies, however, pre-K researchers have only been able to follow students through elementary school. This brief looks at examples of additional, sometimes less frequently measured types of skills that pre-K programs may help boost in the short term and sustain over the longer term. It then presents evidence from existing studies of pre-K programs conducted by MDRC and other researchers that shows how measuring a broader set of outcomes is key to a more comprehensive understanding of the benefits of pre-K programming.

This longitudinal study reports Ohio State Test (OST) scores along with the demographic factors of gender, socioeconomic status, student race, and attendance rate to determine the impact of STEM programming. The use of multilevel, statistical analyses through hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) determined integrated STEM had a significant, positive effect on student achievement in both math and science and an even stronger impact isolating science achievement by itself. The predictive results of HLM analysis determined STEM students scored significantly higher on the OST in science and math combined scoring 31.8 points higher on average and 38.2 points higher in science compared to their general education peers. No interaction effects were determined between STEM participation and gender, socioeconomic status, student race, and attendance rate.

To accomplish this, the conceptual framework that includes all the investigation objects needs to be accurately captured and communicated to all data consumers. A large part of this requires using metadata standards to annotate data collected. These standards should be readily accessible, informed by scientific community consensus and sufficiently specific to encompass all of the important aspects of the investigation. Starting in 2020 we have been co-leading an open consortium to develop a new metadata standard, the Radiation Biology Ontology (RBO), through the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry [3]. We began by transforming many of the terms from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement into concepts that can be formally related to existing OBO Foundry classes or attributes. We then identified and imported into the RBO existing OBO Foundry classes that have obvious relevance for radiation biomedicine (for example, concepts from the Environment Ontology that describe radiative processes, and concepts from the Gene Ontology dealing with molecular and cellular responses to radiation). Finally, we scrutinized datasets from investigations of radiation effects held in NASA GeneLab and LSDA repositories and added additional classes, instances, and attributes into the RBO that should be used to annotate these data. We developed the RBO using the open-source tools of GitHub and publish the RBO periodically through the NIH/NCBI BioPortal website, so systems worldwide can leverage the knowledge it contains [4]. This initial phase of concept modeling has yielded an RBO that at present has more than 300 declared concepts, with more than 3500 additional concepts imported from other OBO Foundry ontologies. While this first phase has focused on concepts for annotating samples, environments, exposures, and measurements, the next phase will center on supporting annotation of results and findings, such as concept models of molecular, cellular and tissue effects. The value of the RBO will be determined in part by our ability to engage the community in its development, and we have established a Radiobiology Informatics Consortium with unrestricted membership as the owner of the RBO in order to encourage investigators, system owners and other to join in this effort. Anyone can report issues or request new concept modeling or other features directly on GitHub. By using the BioPortal application programming interface, systems can pose dynamic queries to the latest version of the RBO for information on individual classes or entire hierarchies; this design eliminates the need for systems to be updated in order to use newer versions of the RBO. We hope to contribute to the advancement of open radiobiological science through the continued, open development of the RBO, that will provide more precise, machine-interpretable descriptions of investigations, as well as support data meta-analysis through machine learning or other artificial intelligence methods.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']",

These AJTs are hot-gas thrusters which augment the gas flow using an electric arc to increase the exit velocity of the gases. Fuel flow problems have led to GOES-16 being unable to safely use its AJTs for maneuvers at times. This primarily affects North/South Station-Keeping (NSSK) maneuvers, which control inclination and use a majority of the station-keeping fuel budget. As a result, GOES-16 has had to occasionally resort to using non-AJT hot-gas thrusters. These thrusters are not placed as close to GOES-16's centerline, have lower thrust, and have lower specific impulse when compared to AJTs. In addition, MOST’s ground systems do not officially support using these non-AJT thrusters for NSSK maneuvers. MOST had to quickly develop workaround solutions using the FocusSuite Autofocus programming environment to compute the maneuvers. This paper outlines the mixture of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and MOST-developed products which have allowed GOES-16 to continue station-keeping even with inconsistently-per-forming AJTs, showing that script-based automation systems like Autofocus can simplify complex solutions to a few scripted user inputs.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']",

A Bayesian fitness metric is introduced and its impact on bloat and overfitting during population evolution is studied and compared to common alternatives in the literature. The proposed approach was found to be more robust to noise and data sparsity in numerical experiments, guiding evolution to a level of complexity appropriate to the dataset.  Further evolution of the population resulted not in overfitting or bloat, but rather in slight simplifications in model form. The ability to identify an equation of complexity appropriate to the scale of noise in the training data was also demonstrated. In general, the Bayesian model selection algorithm was shown to be an effective means of regularization which resulted in less bloat and overfitting when any amount of noise was present in the training data.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']",

Educators have found that computational thinking enhances learning across a range of subjects and reinforces students' abilities in reading, writing, and arithmetic. This book offers a guide for incorporating computational thinking into middle school and high school classrooms, presenting a series of activities, projects, and tasks that employ a range of pedagogical practices and cross a variety of content areas.</p><p>As students problem solve, communicate, persevere, work as a team, and learn from mistakes, they develop a concrete understanding of the abstract principles used in computer science to create code and other digital artifacts. The book guides students and teachers to integrate computer programming with visual art and geometry, generating abstract expressionist–style images; construct topological graphs that represent the relationships between characters in such literary works as <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em> and <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>; apply Newtonian physics to the creation of computer games; and locate, analyze, and present empirical data relevant to social and political issues. Finally, the book lists a variety of classroom resources, including the programming languages Scratch (free to all) and Codesters (free to teachers). An accompanying website contains the executable programs used in the book's activities.</p><p>The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.</p>

ERIC_ED619758,ERIC ED619758: The Wisconsin School Mental Health Framework: Building and Sustaining a Comprehensive System,E,"In Wisconsin, schools strive to create learning environments where all students and staff feel healthy, safe, supported, engaged, and challenged. To realize this vision, districts and schools partner with students, families, and the community to build a comprehensive school mental health system (CSMHS). A CSMHS increases health equity by ensuring all students and staff have access to the prevention, early intervention, and treatment supports that they need, when they need them, free of stigma. Wisconsin's Comprehensive School Mental Health Framework applies Wisconsin's equitable multi-level system of supports (MLSS) to school mental health. An MLSS is a data-driven, problem-solving framework that utilizes a continuum of evidence-based practices to improve outcomes for all students (OSEP 2021). It includes universal programming to support all students, early intervention, and intensive interventions for those students who need additional support. Wisconsin's equitable MLSS includes all students and staff, considers the whole child and system, and focuses on providing equitable services and resources (DPI 2017c). Rather than creating a separate system for mental health service delivery, schools can leverage existing structures of their equitable MLSS as it applies to academic and behavioral supports to integrate the six components of CSMHS: (1) a continuum of mental health supports; (2) collaboration; (3) needs assessment and resource mapping; (4) mental health referral pathways; (5) sustainability; and (6) data. This document provides an overview of necessary considerations for building and sustaining the six components of a CSMHS to promote mental health for all students and staff.

The expanding user base and diverse range of applications employing this technology can impose significant expectations on the providers of reference network services. In positioning and navigation, the requirement for high accurate coordinate estimates cannot be over-emphasized. This is ensured by the provision of accurate and reliable corrections from the zero-order GNSS reference stations. It is therefore expedient to study the diurnal coordinates of such stations to guarantee reliable information for positioning and navigation applications. In this study, observation data from the Nigerian permanent GNSS continuously operating reference stations located at different states around Nigeria was processed. The hourly and diurnal (daily) coordinate solutions obtained were analysed for the purpose of monitoring the short-term stability of the network coordinates using a two-year (2012-2013) test data. The daily precise point positioning results were processed, analysed, and presented as coordinate time series using RTKPLOT. Python programming language was used to write custom modules to visualize the time series graphs at 30 seconds epochs in order to determine points and epochs where and when the condition for stability defaulted. The stations; FPNO, GEMB, and MDGR were found to be most stable in the Easting component; GEMB and MDGR were the most stable in the Northing component while in the Up component the station GEMB was the most stable. The outcome of the study will assist in detecting stations that are non-operational, performing diurnal PPP processing to detect stations that are unstable, and reporting reference stations that experience sudden coordinate changes. The developed monitoring module can be implemented by the reference stations operators as an automated program for setting up an intelligent alert system to trigger a warning whenever there is unexpected coordinate breach.</em></p>","['folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']",

Yet policymakers, administrators, and teachers often wrestle with the complexities of providing these programs on a large scale and in rapidly evolving contexts. This can undermine opportunities to close income and racial inequities in early learning. A key challenge is the lack of reliable, unbiased data about children's skills, knowledge, behaviors, and classroom experiences--information that could guide teacher practice and inform investments in early learning systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the pressing need to collect this type of data as part of the normal operation of pre-K sys­tems. As the nation emerges from the pandemic, in-person pre-K activities have resumed with scant information about how children fared over the past year and a half. This limits how instruction and support can be effectively aligned to meet the needs of teachers and the young children they serve. The routine collection of such information on a scale large enough to appropriately answer questions about what works and why, for whom, and under what conditions, is critical to the future of effective and equitable pre-K programming. MDRC, in collaboration with Substantial, a human-centered design firm, and with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is leading an initiative aimed at shifting the data landscape across the early learning and pre-K field.

WCER Working Paper No. 2021-6,E,"Created by LatCrit scholars in the mid-2000s, Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) is an antideficit framework for understanding educational inequality. Since its publication, Yosso's (2005) seminal paper on the topic has been cited thousands of times by scholars in fields as distinct as engineering, K-12 education, and public health. This paper reviews the recent scholarship on college students' experiences and outcomes that uses CCW as a guiding framework. Although the intended audience for this review is career services professionals in colleges and universities, my hope is it can also be helpful for scholars of career development who want to brush up on the CCW literature and consider future research questions the framework presents. The existing literature offers insights on the college-to-career transition. It reveals the centrality of familial capital in shaping students' career pathways, the function of resistant capital in forming students' career interests, the utility of students' existing social capital in the job search process, and the role of counterspaces in activating CCW for career success. However, CCW scholarship typically focuses on college students' matriculation, persistence, sources of support, and wellbeing, not on their career development--including the psychological, spiritual, sociocultural, political and economic factors influencing students' career interests and the knowledge, relationships, and environmental contexts shaping their career choices (Duffy &amp; Dik, 2009). This gap presents opportunities for researchers and career services professionals to partner in creating and evaluating programming with CCW in mind. There are also opportunities to increase the methodological diversity of CCW scholarship, to consider the ways in which students mix CCW with ""dominant"" forms of capital for career success, to collect data from employers, faculty, and other gatekeepers, and to account for the role of institutional context.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED615319,ERIC ED615319: Recommendations for Providing Levels of Services for Gifted and Advanced Students. Revised,E,"This document provides guidance for establishing a levels of services (LoS) model for gifted and advanced learners. The Advisory Council on the Education of Gifted and Talented Students recommends that all Missouri public school districts, regardless of size, provide varied and multiple services to meet the needs of gifted and talented learners. These services should be in addition to and complement a state approved gifted education program. In the absence of such vital programs, multiple elements of the LoS model should still be utilized. To best meet the needs of all gifted and talented students, the National Association for Gifted Children's (NAGC) Gifted Programming Standards recommend that a continuum of services must exist for gifted learners at every level. These levels of services provide administrators, teachers, parents, and students with a menu of educational options that are respectful of individual student differences and mindful of classroom and community resources while allowing for gifted and talented children to thrive in the least restrictive environment for their abilities. Prominent interventions for meeting the needs of all students, including those who are gifted and talented, include Professional Learning Communities, Response to Intervention, and Levels of Services, all of which are addressed in this report.

The following report makes the case for building greater resilience against the growing problems of misinformation and disinformation by equipping our teachers and students with the tools and skills they need to face and understand those problems. It begins with an exploration of the history of various terms and concepts, from media and digital literacy to digital citizenship and civics to cybersecurity awareness. The report finds that their respective treatments of skills, ethics, and threats is crucially needed--and that they now cross at what might be conceived of as ""cyber citizenship."" This conceptual intersection allows a new kind of coalition-building, drawing together groups in fields that range from education to public interest technology to national security, who all now share an interest in tackling these challenges. The report explores nascent research on the efficacy of such programming and the challenges of implementing them in schools in the United States. It describes the recent growth in new tools and sites for educators to teach such skills--but also highlights the problem of finding and comparing these resources. To tackle this problem, the report describes a forthcoming cyber citizenship portal for educators and offers a series of recommendations for policymakers and philanthropies alike. It concludes with a vision of what success might look like: a world in which our children and society are equipped to succeed in 21st century life, with resilience against the information threats that so challenge us now. And we conclude with a diagram of an emerging network of organizations as well as a vision for building skills and mindsets for cyber citizenship.

10-18153,Mapping log data activity using heuristic miner algorithm in  manufacture and logistics company,S,"Strategies for the procurement of goods and services are essential for 
companies in Indonesia's manufacturing and logistics sectors. The solution to 
reducing the existing problem is to make a mapping plan, such as verifying 
documents from each department, so that it takes a long time, resulting in many 
issues, such as procedural misuse findings. Heuristics miner algorithms get 
data to form logs that consist of goods and services procurement activities. 
Processing log data into XML data (data extraction), which produces a 
dependency model and business and casual matrix (discovery process), then 
determines the value of fitness and precision (suitability) called the conformity 
checking phase process. This phase aims to produce a new business (process 
enhancement phase), which will create a solution to the risk of delay and 
procedural abuse. The results of each of these processes rank each stage of the 
procurement of goods and services sequentially and together to provide time efficient and accurate decisions, resulting in project implementation

ERIC_ED614101,ERIC ED614101: How New Brunswick Implemented Its Computer Science Education Program,E,"Computer science (CS) education helps students acquire skills such as computational thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. Since these skills take preeminence in the rapidly changing 21st century, CS education promises to significantly enhance student preparedness for the future of work and active citizenship. Based on prior analyses and expert consultations, the authors selected 11-CS education country, state, and provincial case studies that may have lessons that can broadly apply to other education systems. These cases come from diverse global regions and circumstances and have implemented CS education programs for various periods and to different levels of success. As such, they have examined information to extract lessons that can lead to successful implementation. This study examines how New Brunswick seeks to improve and expand its CS education activities to train a future workforce that can thrive during economic transition and support the Canadian province's budding technology sector. The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) and various stakeholder organizations aim to give all students the opportunity to learn CS and apply their lessons in a creative and collaborative environment. In the early 2000s, the DEECD decided to refocus its curriculum on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, including ICT (information and communications technology). This brought the necessary infrastructure and knowledge of digital technologies into schools that would later set the stage for mandatory CS courses in 2017. The DEECD also faced the challenge of rolling out CS education for students of two distinct language groups. Primary school teachers in the anglophone sector were encouraged to incorporate CS and computational thinking as interdisciplinary subjects, while the francophone sector had no requirement to offer either subject in primary schools. All lower-secondary school students, whether English- or French-speaking, take CS courses that emphasize programming skills. Further, both language systems offer more advanced CS courses in upper secondary school as electives.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

In this book, Florian Jaton offers a new way to study computerized methods, providing an account of where algorithms come from and how they are constituted, investigating the practical activities by which algorithms are progressively assembled rather than what they may suggest or require once they are assembled.</p><p>Drawing on a four-year ethnographic study of a computer science laboratory that specialized in digital image processing, Jaton illuminates the invisible processes that are behind the development of algorithms. Tracing what he terms a set of intertwining courses of actions sharing common finalities, he describes the practical activity of creating algorithms through the lenses of <em>ground-truthing</em>, <em>programming</em>, and <em>formulating</em>. He first presents the building of ground truths, referential repositories that form the material basis for algorithms. Then, after considering programming's resistance to ethnographic scrutiny, he describes programming courses of action he attended at the laboratory. Finally, he offers an account of courses of action that successfully formulated some of the relationships among the data of a ground-truth database, revealing the links between ground-truthing, programming, and formulating activities—entangled processes that lead to the shaping of algorithms. In practice, ground-truthing, programming, and formulating form a whirlwind process, an emergent and intertwined agency.</p><p>The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from Arcadia – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin.</p>

ERIC_ED612470,ERIC ED612470: Lessons from the Illinois Media Mentor Project,E,"In 2020, New America embarked on a year-long initiative with librarians in children's and youth services across three library systems in Illinois. The aim was to build staff members' skills and confidence in media mentorship--the act of mentoring and providing tailored guidance to students and families in selecting, analyzing, and using media to support learning. Librarians are often well-positioned to do this kind of mentoring. Media mentorship is, after all, aligned with what many staff members are taught in schools of library and information science. But they need their own support and training on new techniques and programming innovations to keep up with the ever-changing media landscape. This is particularly true if they never received training on how to be responsive to and effective in helping families and youth in underserved communities who have not historically had positive experiences with American educational systems or who have home languages other than English. Librarians need opportunities to think through and explore, with their peers and other experts, how best to respond to the strengths and diverse media needs of the people they serve. The Illinois Media Mentor Project project was designed to offer those opportunities. This project provided two different professional development options for librarians working at the Chicago Public Library, the Schaumburg Township District Library, and the Skokie Public Library. The final forum included those librarians, as well as other educators, researchers, and leaders of school and library organizations around the country. Giving librarians and other educators space and time to talk about and hone these new skills can lead to greater confidence in their roles as media mentors. They can then forge stronger connections with the youth, families, and educators in their communities and can serve as trusted advisors for seeking out and managing media, using new tools, and identifying quality sources and materials.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED612091,ERIC ED612091: The Need for Program Theory and Implementation Fidelity in Assessment Practice and Standards. Occasional Paper No. 51,E,"On their own, student learning and development outcomes assessment data have limited utility for improving programming. We believe outcomes data should not be collected until two fundamental questions can be answered: ""Why should this programming result in the desired outcome?"" (i.e., program theory) and ""Was the intended programming actually experienced by students?"" (i.e., implementation fidelity). Some assessment professionals may find this proclamation radical. Our call is fueled by the creation of unjustified programming and curriculum, coupled with the collection of outcomes data that are not used for improvement efforts. We contend that it is only after program theory is articulated that faculty and student affairs professionals can collect relevant, useful outcomes data. Moreover, valid inferences from outcomes data are contingent on knowing what programming students experienced. This ""expanded"" assessment practice has potential to afford better-designed, more impactful, research-informed programming to students. As our students have opportunities to engage in well-implemented, should-be-effective programming, their learning should demonstrably improve. Thus, we call for professional standards and professionals themselves to integrate program theory and implementation fidelity into outcomes assessment practice.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED611707,ERIC ED611707: Building Communities of Care in Workforce Development Programs. Strategically Virtual,E,"As COVID-19 continues to affect the economy and labor market and the pathways to recovery remain unclear, state and local workforce agencies continue to adapt to new conditions and challenges to adequately support the millions of unemployed Americans at this time. Over the course of the past year, the demands placed on the public workforce system have grown more complex, and it has become apparent that no one entity or organization can bear the full weight of addressing the diverse needs of those who are currently searching for work. In order to build the capacity to respond rapidly to help residents in times of economic shocks, such as the pandemic, cyclical recessions, and massive unemployment, a key component of our ability to move forward is community. This means harnessing community resources in service of job seeker needs. It also means building communities of care to support the social and emotional needs of job seekers during these times. Researchers at the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development define community building in two ways: the aggregation of resources and services to address unemployment needs, and the creation of safe, welcoming, inclusive spaces where people searching for work can experience connection and belonging. There is a pressing need for services that address the mental, social, and emotional impacts of job search on job seekers. ""Building Communities of Care in Workforce Development Programs,"" a new brief from the Heldrich Center, offers guidance on how to create communities of care that are critical to addressing the all-too-common feelings of isolation, depression, and rejection typically associated with unemployment. With a community-building focus, this approach can tend to the needs of the whole person, more effectively dealing with a range of barriers that impede job search and overall well-being. This brief builds upon lessons learned from New Jersey public libraries in how the public workforce system could navigate a greater role in community coordination and cultivation. Community-focused service provision could be considered a path forward in assisting unemployed individuals in regaining solid ground, so that they may more effectively search for their next employment opportunity. Workforce Development Boards could assume the role of community aggregator and creator as well as make holistic job seeker care an essential component of service delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed demand in the labor market across many industries and sectors, such that traditional job seeker service models and mechanisms will not be enough to effectively help the millions of people searching for work. The public workforce system could consider how a redefinition and expansion of job seeker services to include community-based programming and holistic care could be effective at this time. Heldrich Center researchers believe that the lessons learned and services reconfigured in this time of great need will continue to be beneficial and supportive of job seekers even in future and more prosperous times.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

Research suggests that one of the most significant impacts of the pandemic is exacerbating existing inequality and widening achievement gaps. A condition associated with the American Rescue Plan Act funding is that 20% of district funds must address student learning loss. The COVID-19 learning loss--or, as we call it, learning privilege--is grounded in the fact that some students were able to learn this past year, whereas others were not. Bridging the gap is essential to prevent additional disengagement of students who are behind. Given that the shortage of effective teachers disproportionately impacts students who are at a disadvantage in both schools and society, states are in a critical position to use these funds to address equity and opportunity gaps. Investing in supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce in underserved schools is essential to avoid the risk of widening gaps. Yet, without effective teachers in every classroom, states may not experience the highest gains from their ESSER investments. Simply put, the best way to invest in students is to invest in teachers first. We urge education leaders to make significant, strategic investments in educators to stabilize the educator workforce and address teacher shortages. These investments will be essential to ensuring that all other investments find solid ground.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

This problem has proven to be exceptionally difficult: for humans, it requires large amounts of manual work, and for computers, until recently, achieving anything near human-level accuracy has been unattainable. In this paper, we present generative grading: a novel computational approach for providing feedback at scale that is capable of accurately grading student work and providing nuanced, interpretable feedback. Our approach uses generative descriptions of student cognition, written as probabilistic programs, to synthesise millions of labelled example solutions to a problem; we then learn to infer feedback for real student solutions based on this cognitive model. We apply our methods to three settings. In block-based coding, we achieve a 50% improvement upon the previous best results for feedback, exceeding human-level accuracy. In two other widely different domains--graphical tasks and short text answers--we achieve improvements over the previous state of the art by about 4x and 1.5x respectively, approaching human accuracy.

Design quality is an important consideration since it affects the readability and maintainability of programs. Assessing design quality and giving personalized feedback is very time consuming task for instructors and teaching assistants. This limits the scale of giving personalized feedback to small class settings. Further, design quality is nuanced and is difficult to concisely express as a set of rules. For these reasons, we propose a neural network model to both automatically assess the design of a program and provide personalized feedback to guide students on how to make corrections. The model's effectiveness is evaluated on a corpus of student programs written in Python. The model has an accuracy rate from 83.67% to 94.27%, depending on the dataset, when predicting design scores as compared to historical instructor assessment. Finally, we present a study where students tried to improve the design of their programs based on the personalized feedback produced by the model.

A first step generates abstract execution sequences (AES) from both predefined test cases and abstract syntax trees (AST) of the submitted programs.

Detecting subgoal completion is a challenging task, and most learning environments do so either with ""expert-authored"" models or with ""data-driven"" models. Both models have advantages that are complementary -- expert models encode domain knowledge and achieve reliable detection but require ""extensive authoring efforts"" and often cannot capture all students' possible solution strategies, while data-driven models can be easily scaled but may be less accurate and interpretable. In this paper, we take a step towards achieving the best of both worlds -- utilizing a data-driven model that can intelligently detect subgoals in students' correct solutions, while benefiting from human expertise in editing these data-driven subgoal rules to provide more accurate feedback to students. We compared our hybrid ""humanized"" subgoal detectors, built from data-driven subgoals modified with expert input, against an existing data-driven approach and baseline supervised learning models. Our results showed that the hybrid model outperformed all other models in terms of overall accuracy and F1-score.

ERIC_ED615663,ERIC ED615663: Using Student Trace Logs to Determine Meaningful Progress and Struggle during Programming Problem Solving,E,"Over the years, researchers have studied novice programming behaviors when doing assignments and projects to identify struggling students. Much of these efforts focused on using student programming and interaction features to predict student success at a course level. While these methods are effective at early detection of struggling students in the long run, there is also a need to identify struggling students during an assignment so that we can provide proactive intervention to prevent unproductive struggle and frustration. This work proposes a data-driven method that uses student trace logs to identify struggling moments during a programming assignment and determine the appropriate time for an intervention. We define a struggling moment as not achieving significant progress within a certain amount of time, relative to the amount of progress made and time taken in a sample student dataset. The paper describes how we determine significant progress and a time threshold for struggling students. We validated our algorithm's classification of struggling and progressing moments with experts rating whether they believe an intervention is needed for a sample of 20% of the dataset. The result shows that our automatic struggle detection method can accurately detect struggling students with less than 2 minutes of work with over 77% estimated accuracy.

Whitepaper,E,"The rapid expansion of computer science (CS) instruction in primary and secondary education has highlighted the shortage of teachers qualified to teach the subject. A key strategy for building CS teaching capacity has been preparing teachers of other subjects (e.g., math, technology applications, business) to teach introductory CS through short-term professional development (PD) workshops, online training modules, micro-credentials, and teacher meetups or conferences (Christensen Institute, 2019). As various new CS curricula and activities using different computational representations or programming environments are rolled out each year, it can be difficult for teachers to make sense of how they map to CS standards or fit with existing activities. To benefit a wide range of teachers using a variety of CS curricula across different programming languages, CS teacher PD needs to focus on CS standards and CS content and pedagogical knowledge rather than merely the details of a particular curriculum. This white paper details the elements of effective CS education, known teacher challenges in CS education, and the current state of CS teacher PD. It also describes an approach to address some of these teacher challenges and help teachers understand CS standards and develop their CS formative assessment skills.

The project used design-based methodology, which incorporated video-recorded classroom excerpts, teacher interviews, and teacher analysis and review of their practice. The teachers identified the students' problem solving, collaborating using explicit mathematical and coding language, and being cognitively engaged. They also recognized that their own practice evolved into a more faciliatory role, while their understanding of coding processes grew through learning beside, and through, their students.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED616614,ERIC ED616614: Developing Computational Thinking Ability in Early Childhood Education: The Influence of Programming Toy on Parent-Children Engagement,E,"Technology and smart devices have become ubiquitous staples in every aspect of human life. Given the rise of computation in everyday life, introducing technology to early childhood students requires exposure to logical thinking and problem-solving skills through programming approaches or computational thinking. This research addresses an inquiry into a comprehensive elaboration of the development of early childhood computational thinking. A novel programming toy was introduced as an educational tool based on designated themes in accordance with early childhood education curricula. Five stages were conducted to reveal parental and child engagement in robotics activities and later, interviews were conducted on children's cognitive development from the parents' perspective. Children were observed exploring in various ways by concentrating and paying attention, doing the given activities and expressing their excitement and happiness. The notion that children learn from their social network environment was highlighted by the way in which the children involved in the KARIN programming toy's hands-on activities were driven to be more actively engaged in the exercise. In addition to parent-student engagement, the use of the KARIN programming toy helps to shed light on how students in early childhood learn while away from their social relations during a pandemic.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

While reading, a mental representation is constructed in the reader's mind. The mental model comprises the words in the text, the relations between the words, and inferences linking to concepts in prior knowledge. The automated model of comprehension (AMoC) simulates the construction of readers' mental representations of text by building syntactic and semantic relations between words, coupled with inferences of related concepts that rely on various automated semantic models. This paper introduces the second version of AMoC that builds upon the initial model with a revised processing pipeline in Python leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models, additional heuristics for improved representations, as well as a new radiant graph visualization of the comprehension model.

ERIC_ED610211,ERIC ED610211: College Acceleration for All? Mapping Racial Gaps in Advanced Placement and Dual Enrollment Participation,E,"Advanced Placement (AP) and dual enrollment (DE) are the two most popular programs that allow students to earn college credits while in high school. Researchers have noted several benefits of college acceleration programs on students' postsecondary outcomes. Particularly, these programs offer the opportunity to improve college attendance rates among underrepresented students. Yet, persistent racial disparities in student enrollment and success rates exist in these college acceleration programs. Given the benefits of AP and DE enrollment for students' college success, especially for students from underrepresented groups, racial gaps in participation rates would be important indicators of educational inequality. However, little is known about how racial gaps are distributed geographically and what factors may mitigate or exacerbate these disparities. This report discusses the patterns of racial enrollment gaps in AP and DE programs across thousands of US school districts. To explain these racial disparities in college acceleration programs, the authors analyze how school-related and non-school factors influence these gaps. The authors find that the vast majority of districts have racial enrollment gaps in both programs, with wider gaps in AP than DE. Additionally, the results indicate that geographic variations in these gaps can be explained by local and state factors. The authors also find that district and state policies that seek to provide increased college acceleration programming are associated with wider racial enrollment gaps, implying that greater resources may engender racial disparity without adequate efforts to provide equitable program access to minority students.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
acomputationalfr1094566669,A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR OPTIMIZATION-BASED INTERDEPENDENT INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS AND VULNERABILITY,K,"Civilian communities and military installations operate numerous critical infrastructure systems to deliver services like power, water, mobility, and communications to people and missions. The vulnerability of these systems can be measured by considering the robustness of each infrastructure network on its own or by considering the interdependencies between different networks. Diverse infrastructure network models are available to analyze system vulnerability, yet a standard architecture for linking pre-existing models for interdependent analysis does not exist. We develop a computational framework to generate combined models that link multiple network-flow optimization models together for interdependent analysis. We validate our methods and implementation in the Python programming language with well-studied interdependent energy networks. We further demonstrate the versatility of our methods by developing a new assessment of fictitious energy and transportation networks with models not originally created with interdependencies. Overall, this work develops a standard way to conduct interdependent infrastructure analysis with pre-built models and sets a foundation for future analysis of other interdependencies and systems.","['navalpostgraduateschoollibrary', 'fedlink']",

Issue Focus,E,"The COVID-19 crisis has upended students' lives and their career plans, including their ability to line up college internships. As millions of people across the country continue to work or attend school from home, many companies and organizations have had to cancel their internship programs, which are an important part of recruitment and diversity hiring initiatives. MDRC's Gueron Scholars Program (GSP) has continued to operate, despite the disruption caused by the global pandemic. The program typically offers paid undergraduate- and master's-level internships at the organization's New York City office, during which students work hands-on with project teams for eight weeks on a range of organizational and analytical tasks. This year the pandemic caused some of MDRC's research to be put on pause which led to unanticipated budget constraints. As a result, MDRC made the difficult decision to suspend its master's internships and doctoral fellowships for 2020 and focused instead on the undergraduate component of the program. The internship was redesigned to take place virtually for local college students -- in part, because so many organizations and businesses in New York City had cancelled their summer employment opportunities. This Issue Focus shares lessons from MDRC's experience planning and implementing a virtual learning program and offers some things for other organizations to consider if they are thinking about offering virtual programming in the future.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED609277,ERIC ED609277: Expanding the Arts across the Juvenile Justice System. Policy Brief,E,"In a one-day count in 2018, an estimated 37,529 youths resided in juvenile placement facilities across the United States. While the estimated number of juveniles in residential placement facilities has dropped by more than half over 20 years, alternative placement to other government juvenile facilities continues to remove youths from their community and education, creating inequitable, unreliable or inaccessible opportunities to engage in the arts. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified persistent inequities in the juvenile justice system, particularly access to resources related to youth well-being and developmental success, such as the arts. At the end of 2019, the Arts Education Partnership's (AEP) renewed cooperative agreement with its federal partners identified juvenile justice as a new focus area. AEP began this work with a landscape analysis on engaging the arts across the juvenile justice system, focusing on programs that employ the arts. This research found that engaging the arts across the juvenile justice spectrum of prevention, intervention, transition and healing is an area that merits further exploration. This Policy Brief captures the discussion, insights and policy considerations that came out of a Thinkers Meeting with 11 experts in the arts education and juvenile justice fields.

The authors conducted research to examine what education and training providers can do to design programs that emphasize equity and better serve individuals who face the most barriers to employment. In interviews with representatives of community colleges and community-based organizations (CBO), and with JFF employees who work directly with workforce boards and training providers, they focused on understanding how the shift to remote delivery has affected training programs--both positively and negatively. Based on what they learned, the authors provide recommendations for ways in which training providers can reimagine and redesign their programs with an equity lens. Five design considerations training providers should take into account as they adapt and revamp their programming in the COVID era are offered: (1) Think critically about the use of technology; (2) Expand options for re-employment; (3) Adopt flexible programming models; (4) Support program staff; and (5) Embrace partnerships.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED607503,ERIC ED607503: The Use of Final Particle &quot;Yo&quot; in Japanese Male-Male Conversations,E,"This paper will analyze the function of final particle ""yo"", and factors that may affect the use of ""yo"" in order to avoid FTAs if there is any. The data used in this paper is a transcription of a 10-minute unscripted excerpt from a Japanese comedy variety show called ""Shabekuri 007"". The excerpt was first aired on April 20th, 2020, under quarantine due to the COVID-19 situation. Final particle, as an important aspect in Japanese language, allows the speaker to convey their attitudes or judgments on the conversation. One of the most common final particles in Japanese is ""yo"". The results show that when the source of information is from the speaker, ""yo"" is used to confirm that addressee receives the information and when the source is the addressee, ""yo"" is usually used to emphasize on different opinions. The frequency of its usage largely depends on the relationship between speakers and level of formality of the conversation. As mentioned, final particles are an important aspect of Japanese conversation, yet often underestimated in Japanese classes. The findings of the paper will show how final particle ""yo"" is used in real situation, thus help Japanese language learners to use it properly to make their spoken Japanese sounds more natural.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED609143,ERIC ED609143: Considering an Online Program Management (OPM) Contract: A Guide for Colleges,E,"The novel coronavirus pandemic sparked change overnight for millions of students and thousands of professors at thousands of colleges around the United States as it began to spread during the spring semester in 2020. Face-to-face instruction ground to a halt and students and schools had to navigate a rapid and chaotic move to remote learning. While many colleges were already developing and expanding online education programs prior to the pandemic, for others, the move to online education is new. To establish an online presence, many colleges are looking for support from outside companies that specialize in the business. In looking to the future, many colleges appear to be considering online program management companies (OPMs). Online program managers are third-party companies--contractors to the institution--that agree to develop and maintain online programming. While some OPMs provide just the technology platform and perhaps support in translating in-person courses to online ones, others are full-service, handling everything from the course design to faculty training to recruitment of students. This report warns that as schools consider how to address distance learning, they should also consider the not-insignificant risks of partnering with OPMs. Contracts are often long, difficult to escape, and expensive. Colleges that see online programs as a financial salvation may learn that the reality is far less rosy. And the reputational risk if things go south could damage the university far beyond any potential upside of the programs. This brief identifies many of the key questions that an institution should ask of itself and its potential online program management contractors before they decide to pursue such an arrangement.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED607967,ERIC ED607967: Rethinking Classroom Quality: What We Know and What We Are Learning,E,"Public support for and government investments in early childhood education (ECE) are at an all-time high. Research has identified early childhood as a critical period for brain development, work that has spurred interest in expanding ECE programs across the United States. But not all programs produce positive effects at the end of the preschool year. For those that do improve children's outcomes, impacts tend to diminish as children enter kindergarten and elementary school. To maximize these significant investments in ECE, programming must be high quality, brought to scale, and generate substantial impacts on children's early learning that can be sustained through elementary school and into adulthood. As the federal and state governments increasingly invest in ECE programs to improve their quality, MDRC is leading several studies that conceive and measure the quality of ECE classrooms in new and innovative ways. In particular, MDRC is focusing on ""instructional quality"" by examining promising instructional practices, such as the use of rich content and individualized activity settings and the promotion of higher-order skills within a broad range of learning domains. In doing so, MDRC aims to improve the understanding of the critical aspects of instructional quality that promote school readiness among low-income children and their sustained academic success as they move through elementary school and beyond.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED608788,ERIC ED608788: Strengthening the Transition from Pre-Service to In-Service Training for New Teachers: Findings from a Study of Teach for America&apos;s Handoff Program,E,"Teach For America (TFA), founded in 1989, has grown to become one of the largest providers of educators in the country for high-needs, under-resourced schools. TFA recruits high-performing college graduates and professionals and prepares them for teaching during five to seven weeks of intensive pre-service training at one of its regional or national summer ""institutes"" before their first teaching job. During their first year in the classroom, the new teachers (called ""corps members"") then receive ongoing in-service training from regional TFA teams. About 43 percent of TFA's corps members receive their pre-service training at a national institute, followed by in-service training from a regional team. The rest of the corps members receive both their pre-service and in-service training regionally. As TFA has grown, and in particular with its introduction of a redesigned national training model in 2016, the regional in-service training has not always aligned well with the pre-service training offered at the national institutes. In 2017, TFA was awarded a Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant from the U.S. Department of Education to create and implement what it called the ""Handoff,"" intended to strengthen the alignment between the national pre-service training and the regional in-service training. The project emphasized three aspects of the in-service training: (1) Providing continued programming for new teachers (called ""corps members"") focused on creating and maintaining a productive ""learning environment""; (2) Deepening corps members' knowledge, skills, and mindsets with regard to ""diversity,"" ""equity,"" and ""inclusiveness""; and (3) Tying these two ideas together to strengthen their practice as aspiring ""culturally relevant practitioners."" MDRC, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, was chosen to be the independent evaluator of the Handoff, as part of TFA's SEED grant. The study of the Handoff had two objectives: (1) to examine how it was implemented and how well it succeeded in aligning the in-service and pre-service training, and (2) to examine the effects of the Handoff on the short-term outcomes of the first cohort of corps members to participate in it. This report explains that there was quite a bit of variation in the implementation of the Handoff among and within the TFA regions, and it suggests that receiving more training on diversity, equity, and inclusiveness and on maintaining a productive learning environment is associated with better practices by corps members in those areas.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED608914,ERIC ED608914: Secondary Education Guidance: Multiple and Flexible Pathways,E,"There are nearly 200 million lower and upper secondary age adolescent girls and boys out of school globally, and if current trends continue, another 825 million children will not acquire basic secondary-level skills by 2030. Global momentum to achieve universal primary education has placed increased demands on secondary education systems to serve more students, from a wider range of backgrounds, and to do so more effectively and inclusively. Many of the most marginalized adolescents in lower income countries who are enrolled in school have fallen years behind their peers. In alignment with the focus on the most marginalized adolescent girls and boys brought forward in the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018-2021) (see ED608930), this guidance offers differentiated recommendations for countries at various stages of the progressive universalization of lower and upper secondary education. It presents principles of good programming, key concepts, and useful tools and resources to orient CO programming on secondary education, using data to identify where and which adolescents are in and out of the education system and why. Additionally, it presents programming recommendations and illustrative case studies aligned to the strategic plan, as well as costing and financing models, monitoring and evaluation tools, and insights on advocacy and partnerships.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED609735,ERIC ED609735: Ending Campus Sexual Violence: Outcomes from the Culture of Respect Collective Program,E,"Over the last decade, sexual violence in higher education has been a focus for colleges and universities, student activists, parents and families, and the media alike. As institutions responded to these complaints and students demanded action and accountability, it became clear there were too few resources available to address this issue. Specifically, there was a paucity of programs or frameworks to effectively guide colleges and universities in making the organizational and cultural change necessary to prevent sexual violence at the primary level of intervention. The Culture of Respect Collective, a NASPA signature initiative, is a two-year program designed specifically to address the enormity of this issue. Grounded in a comprehensive, evidence-informed framework, the program guides institutions of higher education through a rigorous process of self-assessment and targeted organizational change. This report examines the experience and outcomes of Collective Cohorts 1 and 2, particularly the meaningful programmatic and policy changes they made that further the goal of ending campus sexual violence. At the end of their two years in the program, participating institutions completed or made progress on 85% of the objectives they set for themselves around strengthening sexual violence prevention and response efforts, and 77% saw increased collaboration between departments and colleagues in this vital work. Ninety-two percent of participating institutions also saw an increase in required prevention programming for undergraduate students, and there was an overall rise in institution level interventions. This report considers the factors that facilitated and impeded institutions' success in implementing the program, as well as how the growing number of Collective institutions can impact higher education's understanding of the problem, and how best to address it.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
modelingforsucce1094566037,MODELING FOR SUCCESS: STRENGTHENING HOMELAND SECURITY THROUGH VOCATIONAL-BASED OFFENDER PROGRAMMING,T,"Incarceration rates in the United States are among some of the highest in the world, and offenders' returning to confinement is an issue that needs reform. Correctional agencies need to identify programs to prepare offenders for a better chance at a successful reintegration into society. While many methods attempt to reduce recidivism, research shows that unemployed offenders are overwhelmingly more likely to return to prison than offenders who obtain stable, living-wage jobs with advancement opportunities. This thesis investigated vocational-based programs for offenders to identify best practices and potential gaps, as well as program components that support offender success through job skill training. The research methodology consisted of a literature review, qualitative analysis, and a local case study of the Michigan Department of Corrections' Vocational Village program. Because the research uncovered very little information and data for vocational-based training for offenders, this thesis attempted to fill that gap by constructing a conceptual model for vocational program development that starts with a mission statement and ends with continuous program improvement. Using the information contained within this thesis, agencies might construct a tailored model or framework for instituting a vocational-based program.","['navalpostgraduateschoollibrary', 'fedlink']",
optimizationmode1094566118,OPTIMIZATION MODELS TO SUPPORT A LIMITED OBJECTIVE TEST/EXPERIMENT (LOT/E) OF A BILLET MARKETPLACE FOR ASSIGNING USMC OFFICERS,N,"This research investigates how to optimally assign U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) officers to billets. Currently, the USMC relies on monitors to manually develop the assignment solution based on limited information. This leaves the USMC with a suboptimal use of its resources, and with officers whose human capital is not fully developed or who consider attrition. The research shows essential features of a marketplace from other military branches. Emphasis is placed on those features directly related to meeting the billet requirements, the preferences of Marines and Marines' career paths. This marketplace system requires a substantial amount of information from billet owners, monitors, and officers. Data from a subset of the aviation community were collected and processed to develop optimization models that balance two goals: permanent change of station cost, and Marines' priorities. The models are amenable to extensions that consider additional goals and requirements, as data become available. Experimentation shows insightful tradeoffs in the two objectives and provides efficient solutions, which are useful in presenting alternatives.","['navalpostgraduateschoollibrary', 'fedlink']",

Policy Report,E,"Using data from two of the most recognized studies on the incarcerated population, the ""U.S. PIAAC Survey of Incarcerated Adults"" and a comprehensive evaluation by the RAND Corporation for the Bureau of Justice Assistance, as well as insights from interviews with leading experts in the U.S. penal system and his own observations made over four decades working in prison education, Stephen Steurer explores the role of education in reentry planning and recidivism and presents a compelling case for why we need to take immediate steps to improve the education and skills of the incarcerated population. The paper presents a series of pragmatic and actionable recommendations across three key domains: (1) improvements in training to emphasize the critical role of education in rehabilitation efforts; (2) advancements in policy supportive of correctional education and skill development; and (3) a call for an expansion of a national research agenda to inform continuous improvements for prison educational programming.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED608080,ERIC ED608080: How Long Will It Take Me to Get to School? Transit Times to School District of Philadelphia High Schools,E,"In Philadelphia, if a student chooses not to attend their neighborhood school, other options include schools with specialized programming in the arts, sciences, or business fields, schools with career and technical education options, and competitive magnet schools. But choosing an out-of-catchment school rather than a neighborhood school may require a longer or more complicated commute, particularly for students relying on public transit to get to school. Research has shown that commute time and complexity can influence attendance, academic achievement, engagement in school, and health factors associated with sleep. This report uses School District of Philadelphia high school student enrollment and residence data to estimate student commutes to all 52 traditional district high schools via public transit. Transit data from the 2017-18 school year was estimated how long it would take for high schoolers to get to school using public transit based on where they live and under optimal conditions (i.e., no delays and use of all available routes). Also analyzed was how estimated commutes vary by type of school admission (i.e., Neighborhood, Citywide, or Special Admission) and student residential neighborhood (defined as the City Council District in which they live). The findings of this study, can help guide families and students to consider commute time and complexity when selecting schools. The authors also anticipate that the analysis of variation in commutes may be useful for policy makers at the School District of Philadelphia (SDP) and its School Board, City Council, and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) (Philadelphia's transit authority) as they make ongoing decisions about system-wide school offerings, start times and scheduling options, and transit networks.

ERIC_ED607998,ERIC ED607998: PIPE: Predicting Logical Programming Errors in Programming Exercises,E,"In colleges, programming is increasingly becoming a general education course of almost all STEM majors as well as some art majors, resulting in an emerging demand for scalable programming education. To support scalable education, teaching activities such as grading and feedback have to be automated. Recently, online judge systems have been extensively used for programming training, because they are able to automatically evaluate the correctness of programs in real time and thereby make grading work scalable. However, existing online judge systems lack of the ability to give effective feedback on logical programming errors. As such, instructors and teaching assistants are still overwhelmed by the work of helping students fix programs, especially for those novice students. To tackle the challenge, we develop ""PIPE,"" a deep learning model that is able to ""P""redict log""I""cal ""P""rogramming ""E""rrors in student programs. The model seamlessly integrates a representation learning model for obtaining the latent feature of a program and a multi-label classification model for predicting the error types in the program, thereby allowing end-to-end learning and prediction. We use the C programs submitted in our online judge system to train PIPE, and demonstrate its superior performance over the baseline models. We use PIPE to implement the error-feedback feature in our online judge system and enable automated feedback on logical programming errors to the students.

ERIC_ED608053,ERIC ED608053: Student Teamwork on Programming Projects What Can GitHub Logs Show Us?,E,"Teamwork, often mediated by version control systems such as Git and Apache Subversion (SVN), is central to professional programming. As a consequence, many colleges are incorporating both collaboration and online development environments into their curricula even in introductory courses. In this research, we collected GitHub logs from two programming projects in two offerings of a CS2 Java programming course for computer science majors. Students worked in pairs for both projects (one optional, the other mandatory) in each year. We used the students' GitHub history to classify the student teams into three groups, ""collaborative,"" ""cooperative,"" or ""solo-submit,"" based on the division of labor. We then calculated different metrics for students' teamwork including the total number and the average number of commits in different parts of the projects and used these metrics to predict the students' teamwork style. Our findings show that we can identify the students' teamwork style automatically from their submission logs. This work helps us to better understand novices' habits while using version control systems. These habits can identify the harmful working styles among them and might lead to the development of automatic scaffolds for teamwork and peer support in the future.

ERIC_ED608054,ERIC ED608054: What Time Is It? Student Modeling Needs to Know,E,"Modeling student learning processes is highly complex since it is influenced by many factors such as motivation and learning habits. The high volume of features and tools provided by computer-based learning environments confounds the task of tracking student knowledge even further. Deep Learning models such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) and classic Markovian models such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) have been successfully applied for student modeling. However, much of this prior work is designed to handle sequences of events with ""discrete timesteps,"" rather than considering the continuous aspect of time. Given that time elapsed between successive elements in a student's trajectory can vary from seconds to days, we applied a Time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) to model the dynamics of student knowledge state ""in continuous time."" We investigate the effectiveness of T-LSTM on two domains with very different characteristics. One involves an open-ended programming environment where students can ""self-pace"" their progress and T-LSTM is compared against LSTM, Recent Temporal Pattern Mining, and the classic Logistic Regression (LR) on the early prediction of student success; the other involves a classic tutor-driven intelligent tutoring system where the tutor scaffolds the student learning step by step and T-LSTM is compared with LSTM, LR, and BKT on the early prediction of student learning gains. Our results show that TLSTM significantly outperforms the other methods on the self-paced, open-ended programming environment; while on the ""tutor-driven"" ITS, it ties with LSTM and outperforms both LR and BKT. In other words, while time-irregularity exists in both datasets, T-LSTM works significantly better than other student models when the pace is driven by students. On the other hand, when such irregularity results from the tutor, T-LSTM was not superior to other models but its performance was not hurt either.

ERIC_ED608055,ERIC ED608055: Problem Detection in Peer Assessments between Subjects by Effective Transfer Learning and Active Learning,E,"Peer assessment adds value when students provide ""helpful"" feedback to their peers. But, this begs the question of how we determine ""helpfulness."" One important aspect is whether the review detects problems in the submitted work. To recognize problem detection, researchers have employed NLP and machine-learning text classification methods. Past studies have used datasets that were narrowly focused on a small number of classes in specific academic fields. This paper reports on how well models trained on one dataset or field perform on data from classes that are unlike the classes whose data they have been trained on. Specifically we took a model developed with data from a computer science class with several programming assignments, and tried to transfer it onto an education class focused more on writing research papers. We have attempted to perform such a task on a few models including logistic regression classifier, random forest classifier, multinomial naive bayes classifier and support vector machine. We made several attempts to raise the accuracy of classification, including lemmatizing to deduct variation in data input, and active learning strategies.

ERIC_ED608059,ERIC ED608059: Zero-Shot Learning of Hint Policy via Reinforcement Learning and Program Synthesis,E,"Intelligent tutoring systems for programming education can support students by providing personalized feedback when a student is stuck in a coding task. We study the problem of designing a hint policy to provide a next-step hint to students from their current partial solution, e.g., which line of code should be edited next. The state of the art techniques for designing a hint policy use supervised learning approach, however, require access to historical student data containing trajectories of partial solutions written when solving the task successfully. These techniques are limited in applicability when needed to provide feedback for a new task without any available data, or to a new student whose trajectory of partial solutions is very different from that seen in historical data. To this end, we tackle the ""zero-shot"" challenge of learning a hint policy to be able to assist the very first student who is solving a task, without relying on any data. We propose a novel ""reinforcement learning"" (RL) framework to solve the challenge by leveraging recent advancements in RL-based neural ""program synthesis."" Our framework is modular and amenable to several extensions, such as designing appropriate reward functions for adding a desired feature in the type of provided hints and allowing to incorporate student data from the same or related tasks to further boost the performance of the hint policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL-based hint policy on a publicly available dataset from Code.org, the world's largest programming education platform.

ERIC_ED606157,ERIC ED606157: Improving Equity and Access to High-Quality CTE for Youth and Young Adults in the Justice System. Making Good on the Promise,E,"Ensuring that young people have access to high-quality Career Technical Education (CTE) programs is vital to preparing them for future employment. Yet, youth and young adults in the justice system historically have been left behind in states' and localities' efforts to improve workforce development and employment outcomes. In an economy that is now being reshaped by COVID-19 (Coronavirus), it is more critical than ever that young people in the justice system are fully equipped to succeed in the rapidly changing labor market and meet workforce needs. Advance CTE's latest resource, developed in collaboration with the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center, outlines five key actions that state CTE leaders can take in partnership with juvenile and adult criminal justice agencies and other entities to ensure that youths and young adults in these systems have access to high-quality CTE programs and the opportunity to secure and maintain viable employment: (1) Ensure that CTE programs for youth and young adults in the justice system are held to the same rigorous standards as other CTE programs in the state; (2) Help justice and education agencies and program providers adopt and implement promising practices; (3) Leverage federal funding to support CTE programs in correctional facilities; (4) Appoint a state-level designee to oversee the development and delivery of CTE programming for youths and young adults in the justice system; and (5) Collaborate with justice agencies to collect and share student-level data and program outcome data to enhance accountability of CTE programs for youths and young adults in the justice system. This resource is part of the ""Making Good on the Promise"" series, which confronts the negative aspects of CTE's legacy and defines the key challenges learners face today. The series provides promising solutions to help state leaders close equity gaps in CTE to ensure that each learner is able to attain the promise of CTE -- a high-skill, high-wage, in-demand career.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

Sketching a New Conservative Education Agenda,E,"High-quality early childhood education makes a difference: It increases academic attainment and pro-social behavior, positively affects health, and allows more parents to reap the benefits of work. Conservatives care about early education, but liberals have made headway with universal public pre-kindergarten (pre-K), an expensive proposition that expands the government's footprint with no guarantee of quality. The hefty price tag is one reason more communities have not scaled public preschool. States should provide parents of 3- and 4-year-olds education scholarship accounts, which could be used to pay for various private (including faith-based) and public early childhood education providers. To keep parents working, states should create tax incentives for early childhood programming that coincides with the workday.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED608539,ERIC ED608539: Developing and Sustaining High Quality Special Education Infrastructures,E,"While charter schools have long promised choice for students--including students with disabilities--they face many challenges in achieving that promise, including some shared by traditional public schools and some unique to the charter model. One way charter schools can overcome these challenges is through the creation of special education infrastructures that are geared towards and sensitive to the capacity issues that face these schools. A special education infrastructure is an entity that provides a centralized support system to a cohort of charter schools, accelerating collaboration and the sharing of resources. These resources include programming that is often focused on developing schools' fiscal, legal, human, programmatic, and administrative capacities. Special education infrastructures provide a deliberate and efficient means for charter schools to realize economies of scale, pilot new practices, access philanthropic support, and connect with providers in order to build stronger special education programs. In this report, the Center's Megan Ohlssen and Lauren Krempecki provide specific, actionable recommendations for those who seek to create a new special education infrastructure, to established infrastructures that strive to expand or reorganize, and to those who provide philanthropic support to infrastructures that want to better understand the challenges and opportunities in sustaining a quality infrastructure.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

ERIC_ED605364,ERIC ED605364: Breaking the Code: The State of Computer Science Education in America&apos;s Public Schools. White Paper No. 206,E,"In the fall of 2019, well before the appearance of COVID-19, there was heightened concern among U.S. business leaders, economists and investors about a global economic slowdown and the possibility of a recession in 2020. But a downturn in the technology sector was not prominent among their worries. In the decade from 2018 to 2028 computer and information technology (CIT) occupations were expected to grow by 12 percent, adding more than half a million new jobs, well above the average for all occupations, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In May of 2018, the median annual wage in CIT occupations was $86,320, well above the median annual wage of $38,640 for all occupations. One reaction to the promising labor market was a leap in undergraduate enrollments in computer science (CS) courses and degree programs at U.S. colleges and universities. The number of bachelor's degrees awarded nationally in computer and information science had increased by 74 percent at not-for-profit institutions between 2009 and 2015, compared to a 16 percent increase in bachelor's degrees produced overall. This paper reports on the findings in terms of how CS education is implemented and promoted across the United States, yet it takes no position on the actual need or usefulness of teaching computer science in K-12. Less than half the high schools in the United States teach CS. Girls and students of color are underrepresented in computer science classes. There's a need for more certified computer science teachers and more states to create CS learning standards. Even as computer science has accelerated research in health care, climate change and communications, it still finds itself behind the traditional disciplines of chemistry, biology, and physics within many high schools.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED605423,ERIC ED605423: Exploring New Research on Pre-K Outcomes. Policy Brief,E,"As pre-K programming increasingly garners more political attention and funding in the states, policymakers are seeking the most up-to-date and rigorous research to support decision-making and creation or expansion of these programs. High-quality pre-K has bipartisan support in part because of the vast amount of existing research detailing positive benefits -- notably that it is of great benefit to students from low-income families and those who are dual-language learners. However, some research also demonstrates that positive growth among pre-K students isn't consistently sustained over time. This idea is known as ""convergence"" or ""fadeout,"" because the short-term gains of pre-K attendees may diminish in early elementary school. The reasons for these mixed findings vary. Some researchers have pointed out that large-scale, public pre-K often varies in quality from program to program, making comparisons difficult. Others have suggested that the convergence effect may be a function of the instruction provided in kindergarten and early elementary grades, which often focuses heavily on improving the skills of struggling students who may lack access to pre-K rather than building on the skills of pre-K attendees. This Policy Brief analyzes 15 research studies on the effectiveness of pre-K outcomes in programs across the country and finds evidence of sustaining effects beyond kindergarten.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED606195,ERIC ED606195: From Prevention to Diversion: The Role of Afterschool in the Juvenile Justice System. Issue Brief No. 76,E,"In the United States, involvement with the juvenile justice system can have a long-lasting negative impact on one's life. Young people who are placed in detention facilities are removed from their homes, their families, and their communities. Their education, their ties to society, and their lives are disrupted. Involvement with the justice system -- regardless of incarceration -- can have implications for one's future earning potential and career trajectory, limiting the access one has to educational opportunities, career fields, and available supports. Afterschool and summer learning programs can mitigate risk and support the development of protective factors that help keep young people out of the juvenile justice system. Through a wide expanse of programming opportunities, partnerships, and coordinated efforts, as well as supportive policies -- including the ""Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act"" (JJDPA) and 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative -- afterschool programs keep young people safe, connect them to the supports they need, and help build protective factors and positive social connections that lead to bright futures. The juvenile justice system is working on reforms that will better support these young people and connect them with appropriate services to avoid continued contact with the system. From building protective factors that promote resiliency to fostering connections and trust between youth and their community, and even serving as diversion programs that function as alternatives to detention, afterschool programs can be an essential part of the work to support the young people at risk of becoming involved or currently involved with the juvenile justice system and help reframe and redirect their futures.

ERIC_ED607000,ERIC ED607000: Blueprint4Summer Colorado: Mapping Denver&apos;s Landscape for Summer Enrichment,E,"In 2018 RESCHOOL Colorado launched the Blueprint4SummerCO (B4SCO) website, an online resource that aggregates summer activities available around Metropolitan Denver into a comprehensive searchable database. The RESCHOOL team aimed to both surface summer programming throughout the community and provide families with a tool that would simplify their search efforts. This brief provides an assessment of lessons learned in the first two years since the launch of the B4SCO website. We examined the 2018 and 2019 website data to understand two things: the extent to which the RESCHOOL team met its goals for B4SCO, and what the programming provided on the platform reveals about the landscape of summer programming in the Denver area.

ERIC_ED607153,ERIC ED607153: Moderators of School Intervention Outcomes for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,E,"A prior cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared outcomes for a comprehensive school intervention (schoolMAX) to typical educational programming (services-as-usual [SAU]) for 103 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without intellectual disability. The schoolMAX intervention was superior to SAU in improving social-cognitive understanding (emotion-recognition), social/social-communication skills, and ASD-related impairment (symptoms). In the current study, a range of demographic, clinical, and school variables were tested as potential moderators of treatment outcomes from the prior RCT. Moderation effects were not evident in demographics, child IQ, language, or ASD diagnostic symptoms, or school SES. Baseline externalizing symptoms moderated the outcome of social-cognitive understanding and adaptive skills moderated the outcome of ASD-related symptoms (no other comorbid symptoms or adaptive skills ratings moderated outcomes on the three measures). Overall, findings suggest that the main effects of treatment were, with two exceptions, unaffected by third variables.

To understand the state of skilled trades education in America's high schools, Jobs for the Future (JFF) undertook a 50-state investigation, pursuing both quantitative and qualitative sources of information. Researchers reached out to career and technical education (CTE) directors in each state and the District of Columbia for phone interviews. In addition, they conducted 27 interviews with experts from trades- and CTE-related organizations and local programs to provide additional insights. In total, data was received from 38 states. Key findings include: (1) Trades education operates in a data desert with a few oases; (2) High school skilled trades education offers students high-value opportunities; (3) Despite these opportunities, trades education practitioners report negative perceptions among students, families, and counselors; (4) Most of the skilled trades education data that states collect are not used to improve programming or ensure that programs meet labor market needs; (5) To the degree the data reveal trends, they show a misalignment between student participation and labor market demand for skilled trades workers; (6) Trades education faces looming teacher shortages and significant funding constraints; and (7) These challenges stand in stark contrast to the exciting developments and renewed interest in CTE overall, as well as the innovations in skilled trades education that show how powerful these approaches can be.

Equity starts with educators checking their assumptions and biases. Educators can review outgoing language, materials, images and resources for cultural responsiveness, inclusivity and diverse representation. Reflect on what stereotypes and biases might be presented to learners. When educators simplify curriculum, students may lose important representation of racially and socially diverse perspectives. What singular stories are being told and who is being centered in the learning? Educators should create and maintain norms that honor, value and respect diverse perspectives and voices during live virtual learning sessions, chat functions and collaborative activities. Utilize the expertise of staff who are familiar with regulations and best practices for working with special populations. Liaisons, advocates and paraprofessionals can assist teachers in delivering continuous learning.

ERIC_ED607095,ERIC ED607095: Catalyzing Future Directions of Social and Emotional Learning Assessment. Summary Report,E,"Early in 2019, the National Commission Report, ""From a Nation at Risk to a Nation at Hope,"" highlighted the urgency for new paradigms of research to practice partnerships, engaging all stakeholders in contributing to the understanding and use of data to drive social, emotional, and academic learning. Additionally, the National Commission called for the explicit teaching of social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Rigorously evaluating SEL programming with assessments that are both ecologically and psychometrically valid is a pivotal pathway to these ends. When done well, assessments can empower teacher autonomous and authentic instruction, student voice, and the continuous improvement of school culture. Simultaneously, advancing assessment methodologies also promotes the sustainability of effective SEL practices throughout the school community. Assessments that accurately capture the impact of SEL for students, their teachers, parents, and the school community can drive systemic and sustainable change and have an enduring impact on both policy and practice. In October 2019, 63 stakeholders reflecting the national social and emotional learning (SEL) assessment field participated in a full-day work session to build on the vision articulated by the Assessment Work Group's ""State of the Field Report"" (Assessment Work Group, 2019) and National Commission Report by generating ideas and forging partnerships to launch the most essential next phases of work related to SEL assessment. Through carefully facilitated discourse, five essential next phases of work were identified. This report shares the process and findings from the day and concludes with a plan for advancing the essential next steps as a collective through the development and sharing of introductory SEL assessment learning modules.

terrorismprevent1094564898,TERRORISM PREVENTION THROUGH COMMUNITY POLICING,W,"Mass casualty, premeditated, and targeted violence incidents connected with extremism and hate are on the rise in the United States. The year 2019 saw more mass killings in the United States than ever recorded in one calendar year. Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) is the government-funded program that intended to mitigate these threats, but diverse community groups labeled CVE a discriminatory spying campaign, focused exclusively on Muslim community members. This thesis explores whether CVE might benefit from the integration of community policing strategies and, if so, what strategies from community policing would make future CVE programs more successful. Using an appreciative inquiry approach, this thesis evaluates CVE pilot programs, including current community policing models in Los Angeles and New York City. Recommendations include abandoning the phrase “countering violent extremism”; creating an all-inclusive, whole-community approach; empowering all front-line police officers to be problem solvers; cultivating citizen involvement in the design and structure of violence prevention programs; educating police officers on hate crimes, violent extremism, and the radicalization process; separating all community-focused violence programming from intelligence collection and criminal investigation teams; and gaining endorsements of such programs from executive-level law enforcement managers.","['navalpostgraduateschoollibrary', 'fedlink']",

ERIC_ED607787,ERIC ED607787: Automatic Subject-Based Contextualisation of Programming Assignment Lists,E,"As programming must be learned by doing, introductory programming course learners need to solve many problems, e.g., on systems such as 'Online Judges'. However, as such courses are often compulsory for non-Computer Science (nonCS) undergraduates, this may cause difficulties to learners that do not have the typical intrinsic motivation for programming as CS students do. In this sense, contextualised assignment lists, with programming problems related to the students' major, could enhance engagement in the learning process. Thus, students would solve programming problems related to their academic context, improving their comprehension of the applicability and importance of programming. Nonetheless, preparing these contextually personalised programming assignments for classes for different courses is really laborious and would increase considerably the instructors'/monitors' workload. Thus, this work aims, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to automatically classify the programming assignments in Online Judges based on students' academic contexts by proposing a new context taxonomy, as well as a comprehensive pipeline evaluation methodology of cutting edge competitive Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our comprehensive methodology pipeline allows for comparing state of the art data augmentation, classifiers, beside NLP approaches. The context taxonomy created contains 23 subject matters related to the non-CS majors, representing thus a challenging multi-classification problem. We show how even on this problem, our comprehensive pipeline evaluation methodology allows us to achieve an accuracy of 95.2%, which makes it possible to automatically create contextually personalised program assignments for non-CS with a minimal error rate (4.8%).

ERIC_ED608426,ERIC ED608426: Head Start Dosage: Is More Better? Research Notes,E,"Early educational interventions, such as Head Start, have been widely recognized as an effective way to mitigate the negative effects of poverty on early learning and development (Camilli, Vargas, Ryan, &amp; Barnett, 2010). In the past decade, there has been a strong expansion of early childhood programming, including Head Start and state-funded prekindergarten programs. However, the cost of the programs calls into question the extent to which this expansion can be maintained. A tension exists between serving as many children as possible and providing the most impact with limited economic resources (e.g., Barnett &amp; Hustedt, 2011; Steuerle, Reynolds, &amp; Carasso, 2007), making the study of program design such as length and intensity of programming critical to efforts to serve low-income or at-risk children in the most efficient fashion. This paper reviews two frequently cited studies that looked at Head Start programs, the nation's largest early educational intervention, and examined the impact of one program factor, intervention dosage, on children's school readiness outcomes. In the two studies, program dosage was defined as the amount of services children received, and was measured as the duration of program enrollment (i.e., one year versus two years) and the intensity of the program (i.e., half day versus full day).","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",
ERIC_ED608793,ERIC ED608793: Institutional Factors That Influence Creative Arts Students to Pursue Further Education Post-Baccalaureate in an Education-Based Program,E,"Ontario Universities offer a variety of undergraduate programs that could be classified as creative arts programs. Whether these programs focus on one specific major, such as a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting, or concurrent programming, such as a concurrent music and education program, students have a variety of choices for their post-secondary studies. The current body of scholarly literature examines many reoccurring factors that influence a student's choice post- baccalaureate. These factors include socio-economics, institutional characteristics, and student experience. A majority of literature addressing these three factors focuses on students enrolled in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs, suggesting a gap in the literature with a minimal focus on students from programs found within the humanities. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to investigate the institutional factors that influence the decisions of students with a creative arts undergraduate degree to continue their studies within a faculty of education. An online survey was sent out to Ontario Universities with a Faculty of Education, allowing participants to comment on institutional factors that may have had an influence on their decision to further their studies.

However, very little research is being done and has little place in educational policies. This is especially important in applications and continuity courses such as coding and robotics. This is because out-of-school learning environments for skills that require this type of practice remain limited or not available to all students. The aim of this study is to determine whether secondary school students are doing any learning activities during the summer holidays for the subjects of Information Technologies and Software (ITS) and to determine whether there are learning losses during the summer holiday return. For this purpose, a working group was formed with 5th and 6th grade students. For the determination of summer holiday activities, interview form and knowledge test for the determination of forgetfulness were developed and applied to students before and during the holiday return. According to the results of the research, it is seen that middle school students perform many out-of-school activities for ITS during the summer holidays. Coding and robotics are at the top of the topics. It was determined that the most block-based coding activities were among the activities. When the levels of forgetfulness are addressed, it was seen that there was no learning loss.","['ericarchive', 'additional_collections']",

In part, this may be due to exposure to adverse school contexts that create socialization influences supporting aggression. In the current study, 356 children from low-income families (58% White, 17% Latinx, 25% Black; 54% girls) were followed from preschool through seventh grade. Longitudinal data included measures of the school-level contexts experienced by study participants during their elementary and middle school years, including school levels of poverty (percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch) and academic achievement (percentage of students scoring below the basic proficiency level on state achievement tests). Regression analyses suggested little impact of these school-level contexts on teacher or parent ratings of aggression in fifth grade, controlling for child baseline aggression and demographics. In contrast, school-level contexts had significant effects on child aggression in seventh grade with unique contributions by school-level achievement, controlling for child fifth grade aggression and elementary school contexts along with baseline covariates. These effects were robust across teacher and parent ratings. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding the school-based socialization of aggressive behavior and implications for educational policy and prevention programming.
