The method of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies is intended to reduce the dimensionality of the space for searching for neural network parameters in the form of gradual development of its structure in the process of evolution. A software toolkit has been developed to support the approach, which is based on the construction of high-level specifications of algorithms represented in systems of algorithmic algebras, and generation of corresponding programs based on implementation templates in a target programming language. Parameterized algorithms called hyperschemes are used to solve a certain class of problems. Setting specific values of parameters and subsequent interpretation of hyperschemes allows obtaining algorithms adapted to specific application conditions. The developed program design and synthesis toolkit provides step-by-step development of programs, starting from a high-level algebraic-algorithmic specification. At the output of the toolkit, a program is automatically generated in one of the target programming languages (С, С++, Java, Python), that also include a subject-oriented language for designing neural networks. The mentioned language includes operators and conditions for working with populations, configurations, genomes, and fitness function. The work of the toolkit is illustrated by the example of designing a parameterized evaluation algorithm for a binary multiplexer and generation of a program for the single-pole balancing problem.","['aipi.ua-collection', 'additional_collections']"

    摘要:
   </b>
   [目的/意义]对新媒体环境下网络节点影响力进行研究，能够深入剖析信息传播规律，从而有助于采取针对性措施对信息传播进行合理控制。[方法/过程]基于信息熵理论构建新媒体环境下网络节点影响力模型，以微信公众号为例进行节点影响力测算，对节点直接影响力、间接影响力和综合影响力进行深入分析，最后运用Matlab软件对所构建模型进行仿真分析。[结果/结论]新媒体环境下网络节点综合影响力随着连接节点数量和节点间互动频率增加而增大，直接影响力和间接影响力也以不同幅度增长，但当间接影响力信息熵值超过100时，直接影响力成为影响节点综合影响力的主要因素。

    Abstract:
   </b>
   [Purpose/significance] The research on the influence of network nodes in new media environment can deeply analyze the law of information dissemination, and thus help to take appropriate measures to control the information dissemination reasonably. [Method/process] This paper constructs the model of users' node influence in the new media environment based on information entropy theory, taking WeChat as an example to analyze the influence of network nodes. By using java programming method, the paper aims to calculate the numerical value of network nodes, including direct influence, indirect influence and total influence. And finally it use Matlab software to simulate the model. [Result/conclusion] Network nodes' total influence increases with the growth in the number of connections and the frequency of interactions between nodes. Direct influence and indirect influence are growing at a different rate, but the direct influence becomes the main factor affecting the comprehensive effect of nodes when the value of indirect influence is over 100.

He also explores the social and cultural forces that provide the atmospher for innovation. The internet was originally built to facilitate collaboration. By contrast, personal computers especially those meant to be used at home, were devised as tools for individual creativity. Isaacson begins this computer and internet history with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter, who pioneered computer programming in the 1840s. ""When it comes to computers, there is one other historical figure, not as well known, who embodied the combination of the arts and sciences. Like her famous father, she understood the romance of poetry. Unlike him, she also saw the romance of math and machinery. And that is where our story begins.""

News, especially at the time of great world changes, began to gain considerable popularity. Washington Post, New York Times, Time, Reuters, Forbes are among the most famous global newspaper publications. An average analyst can spend up to 40 hours a week collecting information about competitors and researching the most popular posts. According to the conducted research, an average of 40 new posts with news per day. The data processing process can be automated using modern information tools to facilitate the routine work of analysts. To analyze the target audience and reach, it is worth considering the text of the message, the number of likes, comments and links. This information was obtained using the Selenium automated web page testing tool using the Java programming language. The time spent on collecting data in the described way from four newspaper editions amounts to approximately 12 hours. The Tensorflow library using the JavaScript programming language is applied to the collected information. Based on information about the number of shares, comments, likes, frequency of news posts, an analysis was carried out using machine learning algorithms. Based on the clustering data, we can observe such a tendency that posts with a large number of likes receive a large number of comments and vice versa. An analysis of the most active hours of users in the network based on news posts is performed. As a result, the highest activity is observed at least three times a day, namely: in the morning hours from 9:00 to 11:00, in the lunch time of the day from 12:00 to 15:00 and in the evening time period from 18:00 to 20:00. This trend is due to the work schedule of most employees during the working week. The resulting statistical information in the work can be used for other content or user behavior in social networks.</span>","['aipi.ua-collection', 'additional_collections']"

The syntax of a programming language is particularly challenging to comprehend, which makes learning arduous and affects the program's testability. There is currently no literature that definitively gives quantitative evidence about the effect of programming language complex syntax. The main purpose of this article was to examine the effects of programming syntax on the complexity of their source programs. During the study, 298 algorithms were selected and their implementations in Java and Python were analyzed with the cyclomatic complexity matrix. The results of the study show that Python's syntax is less complex than Java's, and thus coding in Python is more comprehensive and less difficult than Java coding. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed on the results of a statistical analysis that showed a significant difference between Java and Python, indicating that the syntax of a programming language has a major impact on program complexity. The novelty of this article lies in the formulation of new knowledge and study patterns that can be used primarily to compare and analyze other programming languages.</p>","['journals_contributions', 'journals']"

With the development of technology, the testing process has improved to automated testing, which reduces the impact of the human factor on error and speeds up testing. The main software products for testing are considered to be web applications, web services, mobile applications and performance testing. According to the testing pyramid, when testing web services, you need to develop more test cases than when testing a web application. Because automation involves writing software code for testing, the use of ready-made tools will speed up the software development process. One of the most important test indicators is the coverage of search functionality. The search functionality of a web application or web service requires a large number of cases, as you need to provide many conditions for its operation through the free entry of any information on the web page. There is an approach to data-based testing, which involves working with a test data set through files such as CSV, XLS, JSON, XML and others. However, finding input for testing takes a lot of time when creating test cases and automated test scenarios. It is proposed to use artificial data set generators based on real values and popular queries on the website to form a test data set. In addition, it is possible to take into account the probable techniques of developing test cases. It is proposed to conditionally divide the software for testing into several layers: client, test, work with data, checks and reports. The Java programming language has a number of libraries for working at each of these levels. It is proposed to use Rest Assured as a Restful client, TestNG as a library for writing tests with checks, and Allure report for generating reports. It is noted that the proposed approach uses artificial intelligence for automated selection of test cases when creating a test to diversify test approaches and simulate human input and behavior to maximize the use of cases.</span>","['aipi.ua-collection', 'additional_collections']"
289-updated,Analysis of Code Vulnerabilities in Repositories of GitHub and Rosettacode: A comparative Study,5,"<p style=""line-height:1.785rem;margin:1.43rem 0px 0px;"">Open-source code hosted online at programming portals is present in 99% of commercial software and is common practice among developers for rapid prototyping and cost-effective development. However, research reports the presence of vulnerabilities, which result in catastrophic security compromise, and the individual, organization, and even national secrecy are all victims of this circumstance. One of the frustrating aspects of vulnerabilities is that vulnerabilities manifest themselves in hidden ways that software developers are unaware of. One of the most critical tasks in ensuring software security is vulnerability detection, which jeopardizes core security concepts like integrity, authenticity, and availability. This study aims to explore security-related vulnerabilities in programming languages such as C, C++, and Java and present the disparities between them hosted at popular code repositories. To attain this purpose, 708 programs were examined by severity-based guidelines. A total of 1371 vulnerable codes were identified, of which 327 in C, 51 in C++, and 993 in Java. Statistical analysis also indicated a substantial difference between them, as there is ample evidence that the Kruskal-Wallis H-test p-value (.000) is below the 0.05 significance level. The Mann-Whitney Test mean rank for GitHub (Mean-rank=676.05) and Rosettacode (Mean-rank=608.64) are also different. The novelty of this article is to identify security vulnerabilities and grasp the nature severity of vulnerability in popular code repositories. This study eventually manifests a guideline for choosing a secure programming language as a successful testing technique that targets vulnerabilities more liable to breaching security.</p>","['journals_contributions', 'journals']"

In this work, we present a general data-driven approach, named ""Temporal-ASTNN"" for modeling student learning progression in open-ended programming domains. Temporal-ASTNN combines a novel neural network model based on abstract syntactic trees (AST), named ASTNN, and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. ASTNN handles the ""linguistic"" nature of student programming code, while LSTM handles the ""temporal"" nature of student learning progression. The effectiveness of ASTNN is first compared against other models including a state-of-the-art algorithm, Code2Vec across two programming domains: iSnap and Java on the task of program classification (""correct"" or ""incorrect""). Then the proposed temporal-ASTNN is compared against the original ASTNN and other temporal models on a challenging task of student success early prediction. Our results show that Temporal-ASTNN can achieve the best performance with only the first 4-minute temporal data and it continues to outperform all other models with longer trajectories.

doi-10.11591eei.v9i5.2268,An improved ant colony optimization algorithm for wire optimization,B,"Wire optimization has become one of the greatest challenges in today’s
circuit design. This paper presents a method for wire optimization in circuit
routing using an improved ant colony optimization with Steiner nodes
(ACOSN) algorithm. Circuit delay and power dissipation are primarily
affected by the length of the routed wire. Thus, the main goal of this
proposed algorithm is to find the shortest route from one point to another
using an algorithm that relies on the artificial behavior of ants. The algorithm
is implemented in the JAVA programming language. The proposed ACOSN
algorithm is compared with the conventional ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithm in terms of efficiency and routing performance when applied to
three types of circuits: emitter-coupled logic, 741 output and a cascode
amplifier. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed based on
circuit information such as total wire routing, total number of nets, total wire
reduction, terminals per net and total terminals. From the simulation analysis,
it is shown that the proposed ACOSN algorithm gives the most benefit to
complex circuits, where it successfully reduces the wire length by 21.52% for
a cascode amplifier circuit, 14.49% for a 741 output circuit, and 10.43% for
emitter-coupled logic circuit. ","['folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']"

ERIC_ED608053,ERIC ED608053: Student Teamwork on Programming Projects What Can GitHub Logs Show Us?,E,"Teamwork, often mediated by version control systems such as Git and Apache Subversion (SVN), is central to professional programming. As a consequence, many colleges are incorporating both collaboration and online development environments into their curricula even in introductory courses. In this research, we collected GitHub logs from two programming projects in two offerings of a CS2 Java programming course for computer science majors. Students worked in pairs for both projects (one optional, the other mandatory) in each year. We used the students' GitHub history to classify the student teams into three groups, ""collaborative,"" ""cooperative,"" or ""solo-submit,"" based on the division of labor. We then calculated different metrics for students' teamwork including the total number and the average number of commits in different parts of the projects and used these metrics to predict the students' teamwork style. Our findings show that we can identify the students' teamwork style automatically from their submission logs. This work helps us to better understand novices' habits while using version control systems. These habits can identify the harmful working styles among them and might lead to the development of automatic scaffolds for teamwork and peer support in the future.

It played a major role in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); it provided marker scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs); and it underpinned the analysis of the Global Energy Assessment (GEA). Alas, to provide relevant analysis for current and future challenges, numerical models of human and earth systems need to support higher spatial and temporal resolution, facilitate integration of data sources and methodologies across disciplines, and become open and transparent regarding the underlying data, methods, and the scientific workflow. In this manuscript, we present the building blocks of a new framework for an integrated assessment modeling platform; the “ecosystem” comprises: i) an open-source GAMS implementation of the MESSAGE energy++ system model integrated with the MACRO economic model; ii) a Java/database back-end for version-controlled data management, iii) interfaces for the scientific programming languages Python & R for efficient input data and results processing workflows; and iv) a web-browser-based user interface for model/scenario management and intuitive “drag-and-drop” visualization of results. The framework aims to facilitate the highest level of openness for scientific analysis, bridging the need for transparency with efficient data processing and powerful numerical solvers. The platform is geared towards easy integration of data sources and models across disciplines, spatial scales and temporal disaggregation levels. All tools apply best-practice in collaborative software development, and comprehensive documentation of all building blocks and scripts is generated directly from the GAMS equations and the Java/Python/R source code.","['mendeley_climate_change_library', 'folkscanomy_academic', 'folkscanomy', 'additional_collections']"
analysisofdatadr1094561353,ANALYSIS OF DATA-DRIVEN WEB APPLICATION VERSUS PROCESS-DRIVEN APPLICATION,A,"Enterprise applications are a type of software used in organizations to provide the functions for one or more business domains. The standard approach to developing enterprise application is using common programming platforms like Java EE or Microsoft .NET. However, in recent years new enterprise applications development platforms called Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs) have emerged. BPMS providers claim that their technologies allow organizations to develop enterprise applications faster than by using traditional applications development platforms. No comprehensive comparison of using the two approaches has yet been conducted. The purpose of this study is to compare two enterprise application features, persistence and messaging, available in both technologies—here, Java EE and Bonita BPM. The findings of this study revealed that developing applications using Bonita BPM takes less effort than using Java EE. However, facilitating applications development with Bonita BPM comes with a cost, which is that it limits the developer's ability to use specific preconfigured persistence and messaging technology.","['navalpostgraduateschoollibrary', 'fedlink']"

    Abstract:
   </b>
   Application Programming Interface (API) play an important role with respect to software development. Particularly, the quality of API documentation tends to have a severe impact on the use of APIs for developers. In this paper, for improving API documentation, a novel approach is proposed to automatically detect and repair defective API documentation by adopting techniques of program static analysis and natural language processing. Across empirical studies, the proposed approach gives a precision of 74.6% and a recall of 81.4%, which demonstrates that the approach can accurately detect the defective documentation in java APIs. For further experiments, the function of repair recommendation for API documentation is evaluated. The results indicate that the generated recommendations are correct and succinct, and can repair API documentation effectively.

In the modern computing environment, it encompasses the development of chess engines, chess user interfaces (UIs), chess tournament broadcast tools, chess databases, endgame tablebases (EGTBs) and opening books. In this paper, the author shares his multi-year experience of utilizing most of these components of chess programming in teaching undergraduate courses in computer science (CS) and computer and information technology (CIT). The courses at different levels were taught at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and, most recently, at Purdue Polytechnic Columbus, formerly called Purdue College of Technology Columbus. They involved teaching programming in C, C++ and Java, as well as system administration. We will discuss the courses' structure and learning outcomes, the choices of tools and equipment, how the courses progressed, individual assignments and team projects, the lessons learned, the specifics of getting the students engaged, and the author's plans for the future work aimed at improvement of programming and computer networking skills of Purdue Polytechnic students via their involvement in different aspects of chess programming.

The anatomical information for the models is first segmented from the images and then used by a surface reconstruction algorithm to create 3D meshes that accurately represent the surface of the organs being modeled. The meshes are then exported in an open format for manipulation in a graphics platform. Using high-end graphics algorithms we render and texture-map our meshes. We can also deform the meshes and assign physical and material properties to them. Our models can be used for virtual reality applications and can also be transmitted over the Internet for remote interactive visualization and retrieval.","['dticarchive', 'additional_collections']"

This is just because Kotlin truly offers several features, which other traditional languages (C, C++, Java and FORTRAN) lack. Also, the historic poor performance of Java stops it from being widely used in scientific applications.

The integration of those four elements can be manifested into a learning module which is called multimedia learning or learning by using multimedia. In learning context by using computer-based multimedia, there are two main things that need to be noticed so that the learning process can run effectively: how the content is presented, and what the learner's chosen way in accepting and processing the information into a meaningful knowledge. First it is related with the way to visualize the content and how people learn. The second one is related with the learning style of the learner. This research aims to investigate the effect of the type of visualization--static vs animated--on a multimedia computer-based learning, and learning styles--visual vs verbal, towards the students' capability in applying the concepts, procedures, principles of Java programming. Visualization type act as independent variables, and learning styles of the students act as a moderator variable. Moreover, the instructional strategies followed the Component Display Theory of Merril, and the format of presentation of multimedia followed the Seven Principles of Multimedia Learning of Mayer and Moreno. Learning with the multimedia computer-based learning has been done in the classroom. The subject of this research was the student of STMIK-STIKOM Bali in odd semester 2016-2017 which followed the course of Java programming. The Design experiments used multivariate analysis of variance, MANOVA 2 x 2, with a large sample of 138 students in 4 classes. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be concluded that the animation in multimedia interactive learning gave a positive effect in improving students' learning outcomes, particularly in the applying the concepts, procedures, and principles of Java programming. The difference of students' learning styles--visual or verbal, it can also gave the different effect in students' learning results acquisition.

MOOCs represent an evolution towards the production and offering of structured quality OER. Many institutions that were initially reluctant to providing OER have, however, joined the MOOC wave. Nevertheless, MOOCs detractors strongly criticize their high dropout rates. The dropout rate is a commonly accepted metric of success for traditional education, but it may not be as suitable when dealing with OER, in general, and with MOOCs, in particular, since learners' motivations to take a course are very diverse, and certain self-regulated learning strategies are required to tackle the lack of personalized tutoring and keep pace in the course. This paper presents an empirical study on the motivation and learning strategies of MOOC learners. Six thousand three hundred and thirty-five learners from 160 countries answered a self-report 7-point Likert-type questionnaire based on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) as part of a MOOC titled ""Introduction to Programming with Java"".

arxiv-1703.10674,User Interface Design Smell: Automatic Detection and Refactoring of Blob Listeners,Arnaud Blouin,"User Interfaces (UIs) intensively rely on event-driven programming: widgets send UI events, which capture users' interactions, to dedicated objects called controllers. Controllers use several UI listeners that handle these events to produce UI commands. First, we reveal the presence of design smells in the code that describes and controls UIs. Second, we demonstrate that specific code analyses are necessary to analyze and refactor UI code, because of its coupling with the rest of the code. We conducted an empirical study on four large Java Swing and SWT open-source software systems. We study to what extent the number of UI commands that a UI listener can produce has an impact on the change- and fault-proneness of the UI listener code. We develop a static code analysis for detecting UI commands in the code. We identify a new type of design smell, called Blob Listener that characterizes UI listeners that can produce more than two UI commands. We propose a systematic static code analysis procedure that searches for Blob Listeners that we implement in InspectorGuidget. We conducted experiments on the four software systems for which we manually identified 53 instances of Blob Listener. InspectorGuidget successfully detected 52 Blob Listeners out of 53. The results exhibit a precision of 81.25% and a recall of 98.11%. We then developed a semi-automatically and behavior-preserving refactoring process to remove Blob Listeners. 49.06% of the 53 Blob Listeners were automatically refactored. Patches for JabRef, and FreeCol have been accepted and merged. Discussions with developers of the four software systems assess the relevance of the Blob Listener. This work shows that UI code also suffers from design smells that have to be identified and characterized. We argue that studies have to be conducted to find other UI design smells and tools that analyze UI code must be developed.","['arxiv', 'journals']"

Our framework builds on the EMF/ECore technology and provides a tool that creates an initial model from Java bytecode, as well as a series of transformations that simplify the model and eventually output a timed-automata model that can be processed by a model checker such as UPPAAL. The framework has the following properties: (1) consistency of models with software, (2) extensibility of the model derivation process, (3) scalability and (4) expressiveness of models. We report several case studies to validate how our framework satisfies these properties.","['arxiv', 'journals']"
NASA_NTRS_Archive_20170002277,NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) 20170002277: Ground System Architectures Workshop GMSEC SERVICES SUITE (GSS): an Agile Development Story,N,"The GMSEC (Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center) Services Suite (GSS) is a collection of tools and software services along with a robust customizable web-based portal that enables the user to capture, monitor, report, and analyze system-wide GMSEC data. Given our plug-and-play architecture and the needs for rapid system development, we opted to follow the Scrum Agile Methodology for software development. Being one of the first few projects to implement the Agile methodology at NASA GSFC, in this presentation we will present our approaches, tools, successes, and challenges in implementing this methodology. The GMSEC architecture provides a scalable, extensible ground and flight system for existing and future missions. GMSEC comes with a robust Application Programming Interface (GMSEC API) and a core set of Java-based GMSEC components that facilitate the development of a GMSEC-based ground system. Over the past few years, we have seen an upbeat in the number of customers who are moving from a native desktop application environment to a web based environment particularly for data monitoring and analysis. We also see a need to provide separation of the business logic from the GUI display for our Java-based components and also to consolidate all the GUI displays into one interface. This combination of separation and consolidation brings immediate value to a GMSEC-based ground system through increased ease of data access via a uniform interface, built-in security measures, centralized configuration management, and ease of feature extensibility.","['NASA_NTRS_Archive', 'additional_collections']"
arxiv-1702.07103,Discriminating Traces with Time,Saeid Tizpaz-Niari,"What properties about the internals of a program explain the possible differences in its overall running time for different inputs? In this paper, we propose a formal framework for considering this question we dub trace-set discrimination. We show that even though the algorithmic problem of computing maximum likelihood discriminants is NP-hard, approaches based on integer linear programming (ILP) and decision tree learning can be useful in zeroing-in on the program internals. On a set of Java benchmarks, we find that compactly-represented decision trees scalably discriminate with high accuracy---more scalably than maximum likelihood discriminants and with comparable accuracy. We demonstrate on three larger case studies how decision-tree discriminants produced by our tool are useful for debugging timing side-channel vulnerabilities (i.e., where a malicious observer infers secrets simply from passively watching execution times) and availability vulnerabilities.","['arxiv', 'journals']"
